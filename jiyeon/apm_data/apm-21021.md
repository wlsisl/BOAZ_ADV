INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough there are several essential indications for central\nvein catheterization in small pediatric patients [1], catheter-\nization is not easily achieved in these patients because of\ntheir small size and because the vessels can easily collapse.\nThe subclavian vein, which runs underneath the clavicle\nand lies deeper than the internal jugular vein, is less collaps-\nible and associated with a lower infection rate [2]. Subclavi-\nan vein catheterization can be performed safely and effi-\nciently under real-time ultrasound guidance [3].\n\nCentral venous catheterization has been successfully per-\nformed in pediatric patients using a classical infraclavicular\napproach with ultrasound scanning at the supraclavicular\nlevel [4,5]. However, the optimal length of catheter insertion\nin pediatric patients undergoing subclavian venous cathe-\nterization has not been determined. Most methods suggest-\ned to date utilize an approach through the internal jugular\nvein or are less intuitive [6-9].\n\nA simple landmark-based equation has been suggested\nfor internal jugular vein catheterization [8]. This method al-\nlows a catheter tip to be positioned at the optimal target on\nchest radiographs [8,10]. This method does not require\npre-procedural assessment of demographic or radiologic\ncharacteristics and the landmark-based distances can be\neasily measured during the procedure. However, this meth-\nod has not yet been validated for subclavian catheterization.\nThis study therefore retrospectively assessed the feasibility\nof the simple landmark-based equation in pediatric patients\nof corrected age < 1 year.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n# Study design and population\n\nThe protocol of this retrospective study was approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board of Chungnam National Uni-\nversity Hospital (CNUH 2020-04-12), which waived the re-\nquirement for informed consent because of the retrospective\nnature of the study. The medical records and post-procedur-\nal notes recorded by the physician who performed the cen-\ntral catheterization via the right subclavian vein between\n2016 and 2019 were reviewed. Patients were excluded if they\nwere of corrected age > 1 year. Corrected age was calculated\nby subtracting the number of weeks born before 40 weeks of\ngestation from the chronological age [11]. Postmenstrual age\nwas calculated by adding the gestational age and chronolog-\n\nical age; thus, a 1-year-old infant born at full-term (gesta-\ntional age 40 weeks) would have a postmenstrual age of 92\nweeks.\n\nInfraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein\n\nAll procedures were performed as described previously\n[5,8]. A linear ultrasound probe was placed at the supracla-\nvicular level with the clavicle at the center of the view. The\nprobe was then directed slightly inferolateral to the supero-\nmedial direction. Using an ultrasound-guided in-plane tech-\nnique, the subclavian vein was punctured with an introduc-\ner needle via the infraclavicular route (Fig. 1B). A guidewire\nwas inserted through the needle and the internal jugular\nvein was scanned to rule out cephalad insertion. The dis-\ntances between the landmark points were measured during\nthe procedure with a sterile ruler. These measurements in-\ncluded the distances from the needle insertion point (I) to\nthe tip of the sternal head of the right clavicle (A) and from\npoint A to the midpoint (B) of the perpendicular line drawn\nfrom the sternal head of the right clavicle to the line con-\nnecting the nipples (Fig. 1A  Fig. 1. Landmark points used in landmark-based models (A) and ultrasound image taken during introducer needle insertion via the\ninfraclavicular approach using an in-plane technique (B). (A) 1: insertion point of the needle, A: tip of the sternal head of the right clavicle, B:\nmidpoint of the perpendicular line drawn from the sternal head of the right clavicle to the line connecting the nipples. (B) A linear ultrasound\nprobe was placed at the supraclavicular level with the clavicle at the center of the view. The probe was directed slightly inferolateral to\nsuperomedial direction. The vein indicated in the figure represents subclavian vein joining with the internal jugular vein.). The initial insertion length was\ndetermined by adding the distances from I to A and from A\nto B and fixed after adjusting the length within a 1 cm range\nby considering the occurrence of an arrhythmia, resistance\nduring aspiration, and the placement of an attachment clip.\n\nData acquisition\n\nLandmark-based estimation has been used for catheter-\nization in our center since 2016, and the measurements were\nincluded in post-procedural notes. Gestational age (weeks),\nchronological age (weeks), postmenstrual age (weeks), sex,\nbirth weight, height, weight, length of the inserted catheter,\nand landmark related measurements (I to A [IA] and A to B\n[AB]) were recorded.\n\nAnteroposterior chest radiographs were obtained after the\nprocedure and reviewed by one author. The vertical distance\nfrom the carina to the CVC tip was measured using the Pic-\nture Archiving and Communicating System (PACS) (Ma-\nroview, Marosis, Korea). The optimal insertion length, de-\nfined as the distance at which the catheter tip was positioned\nat the level ofthe carina, was calculated as the actual insert-\ned length 土 the vertical distance between the catheter tip\nand the carina (Fig. 2. Determination of the optimal insertion length on chest\nradiograph. The trachea and main bronchus are outlined by a\nblue solid line. The optimal insertion length was determined by\nsubtracting the vertical distance (V) between the tip and the\ncarina (C) from the actual inserted length. C: level of the carina,\nV: vertical distance between the catheter tip and the carina, O:\noptimal position of the catheter tip.). Correction for vertical distance was\nbased on the consideration that the catheter usually runs\nvertically from the superior vena cava to the right atrium.\n\nDerivation of the estimation method\n\nLandmark-based estimations (IA + AB) were compared\nwith determined optimal insertion lengths (actual inserted\nlength 土 vertical distance). These estimates were subse-\nquently adjusted by determining the optimal intercept that\nminimizes the mean difference between the determined\nand estimated optimal insertion lengths.\n\nTo determine whether a more precise estimate can be de-\nrived from the data of the present study, a regression model\nwas derived by a multiple linear regression analysis that in-\ncluded patient characteristics such as sex, height, weight,\nbirth weight, chronological age, gestational age, postmen-\nstrual age, IA, and AB. Variables with P values < 0.1 on uni-\nvariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis.\nWhen multicollinearity was detected (based on a variance\ninflation factor > 10), the more clinically meaningful or\npractical variable was selected. Finally, a model with the\nlowest Mallow's Cp was chosen using a best subset selection\napproach.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe sample size was based on the available data from Jan-\nuary 2016 to December 2019. No statistical power calculation\nwas performed before the study. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed using R software version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical\nComputing, Austria). Continuous variables are presented as nmean 土 standard deviation (SD), with 95% confidence inter-\nval (CI), or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) after test-\ning for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The\ndetermined and estimated optimal insertion lengths were\ncompared using the Bland-Altman method, which describes\nagreement between two quantitative measurements [12]. The mean difference (estimated - determined optimal length\nof insertion) and the 95% limits of agreement (± 1.96 SD of\nthe difference) were calculated. A clinically acceptable limit\nwas not defined a priori. The estimates from the land-\nmark-based equation and the linear regression model were\ncompared using paired t-tests. Two-tailed P values < 0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOf the 51 right subclavian catheterizations performed in\n42 pediatric patients, one catheterization was excluded be-\ncause of patient age. Thus, this analysis included 50 cathe-\nterizations in 41 patients (Assessed for eligibility (case = 51, n = 42)\nExcluded (case = 1, n = 1)\n- Corrected age over 1 years (n = 1)\nFinal analysis (case = 50, n = 41)\n\nFig. 3.

A comparison between the de-\ntermined optimal insertion length and the estimates using\nthe final model is shown in Fig. 5.

For practical reasons, however, we suggest that a\nsimple landmark-based method be used rather than an esti-\nmation based on complicated calculations. The results of the\npresent study indicate that, with a slight adjustment, clini-\ncians can estimate the optimal insertion length by simple\nmeasurement and arithmetic. This simplicity may enhance\nthe applicability of the method.\n\nSeveral other methods have been suggested to determine\nthe optimal insertion length of central catheters [7,13-15].\nMost of these methods, however, are based on demographic\ndata, may not be intuitive, and/or require complicated intra-\noperative calculations. Additionally, these methods may not\ninclude considerations of inevitable variations due to actual\npuncture sites. Based on the results of our multivariate anal-\nysis, the actual puncture site (IA) was the most important\nvariable for estimating optimal insertion length. In this con-\ntext, we considered the method suggested by Na et al. [8] (a method thatincludes the insertion point as an aspect of esti-\nmation) practical and also applicable to subclavian vein\ncatheterization. To prevent inconsistencies between prede-\ntermined and actual puncture sites, measurements based\n\non landmark points were performed using a sterile ruler im-\nmediately after the guidewire was introduced into the vascu-\nlar lumen.\n\nThe infraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein has several advantages over internal jugular vein catheterization\nin infants [4]. During cannulation, the internal jugular vein\ntends to collapse easily in response to pressure from the\nprobe or needle. Moreover, multiple attempts to perform in-\nternal jugular vein cannulation can result in hematoma\naround the blood vessels. In contrast, the subclavian vein is\nless prone to collapse during cannulation because it is sus-\npended within the soft tissue underlying the clavicle [16].\nAlso, the infraclavicular approach allows direct visualization\nof needle advancement, reducing the risk of complications\nand improving the rate of successful placement. An ordinary\nlinear probe, instead of a hockey-stick shaped probe, was\nshown to be successful in the infraclavicular approach for\ninfants [5]. However, a skilled in-plane technique is required\nto prevent serious complications in these small infants.\n\nThe optimal position of the central catheter tip remains\nunclear [17]. Vessel injury and thrombosis may be avoided\nand proper functioning of the catheter maintained by posi-\ntioning the catheter tip in the right atrium [18]. However,\nvarious problems are associated with deep catheter inser-\n\ntion, including arrhythmia, endocardial injury, and even\ncardiac perforation and tamponade [19-21]. Critically ill pe-\ndiatric patients who require central catheterization are espe-\ncially fragile, making prediction of the optimal insertion\nlength imperative, even for guidewire insertion [22,23]. The\nwire should not be too deep, which may cause endocardial\ninjury or arrhythmia, or too shallow, which may result in\nsub-optimal insertion of the catheter into the superior vena\ncava. Special caution is needed when inserting a straight-tip\nrather than a j-tip wire [24].\n\nWhether deep or not, the actual intended length of cathe-\nter insertion should be based on accurate prediction. The\nsuggested target point of the catheter tip in this study, the\ncarina, can be considered a safe target. The average distance\nbetween the carina and the junction of the superior vena\ncava and right atrium in infants and children undergoing\nheart surgery has been reported to be 1.5 cm (95% CI 1.3-1.8\ncm) [10], with this range (1.3 to 1.8 cm) constituting the clin-\nically acceptable positive limit of error (i.e., estimate - deter-\nmined value > 0).

Nevertheless, however, we\nconcluded that the landmark-based method is also feasible\nin clinical practice, as the mean difference between the two\nestimates was -1.038 (95% CI -2.4 to 0.4 mm), making them\nclinically identical. Also, the estimation based on the regres-\nsion model requires complicated calculations, which are dif-\nficult to be performed intraoperatively. In contrast, the land-\nmark-based method can simply estimate optimal insertion\nlength using intraoperatively measured variables.\n\nThis study had several limitations. First, the data used in\nthis study were not purposefully collected. Therefore, infor-\nmation regarding detailed complications and accompanying\ncongenital anomalies was not recorded. Second, several pa-\ntients required repeated catheterizations. Despite the time\ngap between procedures, autocorrelation cannot be ruled\nout. Third, this was a single-center study, with all procedures\nperformed by a single clinician. Our suggested method re-\nquires external validation. Fourth, based on the limits of\nagreement between the estimates and the determined opti-\nmal lengths of insertion, the estimation should be regarded\nas a guide rather than an absolute target.\n\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that a simple land-\nmark-based method (IA + AB - 5) can estimate the optimal\ninsertion length of the right subclavian vein catheterization\nin pediatric patients of corrected age < 1 year.
