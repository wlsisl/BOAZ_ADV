INTRODUCTION\n\nEmergence delirium (ED) in pediatric patients is defined\nas a 'dissociated state of consciousness, in which the child is\nirritable, uncompromising, uncooperative, incoherent, and\ninconsolably crying, moaning, kicking, or thrashing' [1]. ED\noccurs mainly in children aged 2-5 years [2], lasts for 5-30\nmin and is self-limiting. However, active treatment and man-\n\nagement are necessary to prevent self-inflicted injury, con-\ntamination of the surgical site, and removal of intravenous\n(IV) catheters or drains [3]. ED may also be associated with\npost-operative separation anxiety and behavioral disturbanc-\nes such as sleep and eating disorders [4]. The risk factors for ED include rapid emergence from\nanesthesia, short acting volatile agents, type of surgery, age,\npreoperative anxiety, and postoperative pain [1]. Pain is not the sole cause ofED, but post-operative pain is thought to in-\ncrease the risk of ED. Fentanyl is widely used to control pain\nand ED in children [5,6]. However, in an effective pain con-\ntrol dose of fentanyl, inevitable complications occur such as\nnausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and unwanted deep\nsedation.\n\nThe Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network has shown that\nregional anesthesia in pediatric patients performed while un-\nder general anesthesia and while awake, is safe and effective\nfor acute postoperative pain control [7,8]. Ultrasonography,\nin particular, allows peripheral nerve block to be safely per-\nformed in pediatric patients, leading to increases in the num-\nbers of children administered regional anesthesia [9,10].\n\nAlthough regional anesthesia techniques can help control\nacute postoperative pain, their ability to reduce ED rates re-\nmains unclear. This prospective randomized study evaluated\nwhether active pain control by ultrasound-guided brachial\nplexus block (BPB) can effectively reduce ED after pediatric\northopedic surgery. We hypothesized that BPB would reduce\nthe severity and incidence ofED.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis parallel, randomized controlled, observer-blinded,\nstudy was performed from June 2016 to June 2017. The study\nprotocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee\nof our hospital (no. 2016-05-036-001) and was prospectively\nregistered at the Clinical Research Information Service, a\nclinical trial registry in Korea (KCT0002086). The parents or\nlegal guardians of all included patients provided written in-\n\nformed consent.\n\nInclusion criteria were patients scheduled to undergo\nsurgery for humerus condyle fractures, aged 2-7 years, and\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I. Pa-\ntients were excluded if they had multiple injuries, local infec-\ntion, mental retardation, hypersensitive to amide anesthetics\nsuch as ropivacaine, their parents or guardians refused con-\nsent.\n\nThe primary outcome was score on the pediatric anesthe-\nsia emergence delirium (PAED) scale on arrival at the post\nanesthesia care unit (PACU) [11]. Secondary outcomes were\nscores on the PAED scale and the modified Children's Hospi-\ntal of Eastern Ontario Pain (mCHEOP) scale (Table 1.

[11,12]\nmeasured at 5-min intervals in the PACU, the incidence ofED\nand administration time ofrescue analgesics. The ED defined\nPAED scale on arrival at the PACU > 10.\n\nAll operations were performed under general anesthesia by\na single surgeon (H.D.S.), this surgeon did not enter the oper-\nating room during induction of anesthesia and BPB admin-\nistration. All patients underwent intravenous access in the\nward and were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.04 mg/kg\n30 min before induction of anesthesia. While the caregiver is\nwith the patientin the preoperative area, ketamine 1.5 mg/kg\nwas injected, following which the patient was moved to the\noperating room.\n\nAfter the patient arrived in the operating room, an electro-\ncardiograph, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive blood pressure\nmonitor were attached, and vital signs were measured. Anes-\nthesia was induced with 3 vol% of sevoflurane inhalation and\nrocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Following tracheal intubation with a proper sized endotracheal tube, sevoflurane was adjusted\nwithin 2-3 vol% to maintain blood pressure and heart rate\nwithin 20% of baseline. Mechanical ventilation was set to\nmaintain end tidal carbon dioxide at about35 mmHg.\n\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, enrolled patients\nwere randomly assigned 1 : 1 to the BPB or Opioid group. To\nconceal group allocation, a computer-generated random\nnumber table with four blocks was uploaded into Redcap\n(web based data management program; http://redcap.cnuh.\nco.kr/) and used for randomization.\n\nGroups were allocated by researchers conducting interven-\ntion and excluded from outcome measurements. The pa-\ntients and caregivers, including the nurse who scored patients\nin the PACU, were blinded to group assignments by covering\nthe real and predicted block needle insertion site with small\nsized dressings. Immediately after induction of general an-\nesthesia, patients in the BPB group were administered 0.2%\nropivacaine (0.5 ml/kg) under ultrasound guidance using a\nsupraclavicular approach (i.e., into the intersection between\nthe first rib and the subclavian artery) with MylabTM25 Gold\n(Esaote, Italy) and a linear probe (LA435: 6-18 MHz, Esaote).\nAspiration was repeated in 0.5 ml increments. Patients in the\nOpioid group were administered 1 �g/kg of IV fentanyl at\n2-3 min before incision or pinning, 0.5 �g/kg of IV fentanyl\n\nat 5 min before the end of surgery. All interventions in both\ngroups were performed by a single skilled anesthesiologist.\nThe block was deemed successful if, at the time the arm was\ntractioned or pinned to start surgery, the heart rate had not\nchanged more than 20%.\n\nAfter surgery, the neuromuscular block was reversed with\npyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 4 �g/kg, and\nthe patient was extubated. The patient was transported to the\nrecovery room when appropriate breathing and spontaneous\neye opening were observed.\n\nDuring the stay in the PACU, one nurse trained and expe-\nrienced with the PAED and mCHEOP scales recorded these\nscores every 5 min. Rescue analgesics were administered to\npatients who exhibited a mCHEOP scale ≥ 5 or at the request\nof the parents. Rescue analgesics were IV fentanyl (0.5 �g/kg)\nin the PACU (postoperative 0-1 h) and IV paracetamol (15\nmg/kg) in the ward (postoperative 1-24 h). Frequency of res-\ncue analgesic administration and first request time were re-\ncorded. Postoperative complications including fever, nausea,\nvomiting, and any intervention related complication were\nnoted.\n\nThe number of patients per group was calculated from re-\nsults of other study showing that fascia iliaca block reduced\nmean PAED scale from 10.4 土 3.2 to 7.3 土 2.9 [13]. Using a two tailed. a = 0.05 and a power of 90%, a minimum sample size\nof 22 patients per group was calculated. Allowing for a 10%\ndropoutrate, it was planned to recruit a total of 50 patients.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software ver-\nsion 3.4.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Austria). All\nanalyses were performed by the intention to treat (ITT),\nwhich included patients with protocol violations. Additional-\nly, we also proceeded with as treated analysis to evaluate the\nimpact of protocol violations. The normality of continuous\ndata was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If normality\nwas satisfied, comparisons between groups were determined\nby independent t-tests, with the results expressed as mean\n土 SD. If normality was not satisfied, groups were compared\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test, with the results expressed\nas median (interquartile range). Categorical data were com-\npared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as\nappropriate. Survival outcomes, including time-to-event out-\ncomes and median analgesia times, were analyzed by the Ka-\nplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. For\nall calculations, a two-tailed P value < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOfthe 50 patients assessed for eligibility, none was exclud-\ned. These patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to one of the\ntwo groups. After random allocation two patients were found\nto be in violation of the protocol.

There was no complication in both groups.

The results\nshowed that, compared with IV fentanyl, ultrasound guided\nBPB reduces ED severity and incidence.\n\nRisk factors for ED in pediatric patients include rapid emer-\ngence from anesthesia, use of short-acting volatile anesthetic\nagents, type of surgery, age, preoperative anxiety, and child\ntemperament [1]. There is controversy as to whether pain is\na risk factor for ED. The patients with postoperative agita-\ntion manifested as paranoia had no postoperative pain when\nrecovered to a normal state [14]. Also, ED can occurs in pe-\ndiatric patients undergoing non-painful exam like magnetic\nresonance imaging [15]. Although pain is not the sole cause\nof ED, surgery associated with severe postoperative pain is\nthought to increase the risk ofED. Preoperative analgesia was\neffective in reducing the risk of ED, presumably by delaying\nemergence and reducing postoperative pain [16]. Postopera-\ntive pain control using regional analgesia, such as caudal\nblock, has been associated with ED rates of 20-30% [17,18].\nIn agreement with studies using regional analgesia [13], the\npresent study found that the incidence of ED in the BPB\ngroup were about 36%. These results indicating that complete  neural blockade does not completely prevent occurrence of\nED due to other factors, but incidence of ED significantly re-\nduced.\n\nIt is difficult to completely distinguish ED from pain-\ninduced behavior by PAED scale. Although PAED scale is\nknown to be a representative and useful tool for ED diag-\nnosis, the last two item on the PAED scale (restlessness and\ninconsolability) may reflect pain. Thus, delirium specific first\nthree items on the PAED scale (eye contact, purposeful ac-\ntions, awareness of surroundings) highly correlated with ED\n[17].\n\nProphylactic analgesia with fentanyl has been shown to re-\nduce postoperative pain and ED [19,20]. Fentanyl is routinely\nadministered perioperatively to pediatric patients undergo-\ning surgery. Fentanyl acts as an agonist that binds to m and k\nopioid receptors and has analgesic, sedative, and anesthetic\nproperties. Fentanyl has a rapid onset of action of 2-3 min, a\nshort duration of action of 60 min following bolus doses and\nminimal hemodynamic effects [21]. It is widely used to pro-\nvide rapid short-lived pain relief during surgery. In our study,\nthe opioid group receiving fentanyl was utilized as the active\ncomparator group. The 0.5 �g/kg of fentanyl was adminis-\ntered at 2-3 min prior to incision, and at 5 min before the end\nof surgery. According to the recently published guideline of\nEuropean Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology [22], the\nintraoperative and postoperative fentanyl dose used in our\nstudy seems to be an adequate dose. Decreasing ED is more\neffective with high dose of fentanyl, but the risk of PONV in-\ncreases [5].\n\nSupraclavicular BPB can be used as a sole anesthetic\nmethod in arm fracture surgery [23]. However, BPB is usually\nadministered after sedation or general anesthesia because\npediatric patients tend to be uncooperative. Nerve blocks\ncan be safely performed in pediatric populations undergoing\ngeneral anesthesia or sedation because they do not increase\nthe postoperative rates of neurologic symptoms or the toxic-\nity of local anesthetics [7,8]. In pediatric patients, ultrasound\nguided BPB increases block success rates and improves\nblock quality, as evaluated by block onset, duration and opi-\noid consumption, making BPB excellent for post-operative\npain control [9,24]. Indeed, we found that BPB significantly\nreduced analgesic requirements in the recovery room and\nsignificantly prolonged time to first dose of analgesic. In the\nrecovery room two patients in the BPB group and 12 in the\n\nOpioid group required additional analgesics, with median\ntimes to first dose of BPB being 7 h, the duration of action of\nropivacaine. Although BPB is effective in controlling acute\npain, we observed no difference in the frequency of anal-\ngesics required over the first 24 h postoperative, which may\nhave been due to the small sample size.\n\nMost studies have used PAED cut-offs of 10 or 12 in ED\ndiagnosis [17,25,26]. We have defined 10 as the cut off value,\nbut even with the more strict value of 12, we found that BPB\nlowered the incidence of ED. Although the PAED scale was\nused to measure emergence agitation, no consensus has\nbeen reached regarding an appropriate cut-off value on this\nscale [11,25]. In the studies that analyzed the diagnostic value\nof PAED scale because the definition of ED was based on the\nclinical experience of one expert, it should be interpreted with\ncaution. The diagnosis of ED in pediatric patients is compli-\ncated by the diversity of assessment tools, different definition\nofED and the absence of a gold standard for diagnosis ofED.\n\nThis study had several limitations. Fisrt, there was a pos-\nsibility that maintenance sevoflurane concentration may\nbe lower in the BPB group. This may have resulted in less\nemergence agitation in this group [27,28]. The BPB was\nperformed before the operation resulted in the suppression\nof intraoperative pain. Also, anesthesia depth was not con-\ntrolled based on electroencephalography like BISTM (Aspect\nMedical Systems, USA) [29], and sevoflurane concentration\nwas not recorded. Second, we did not assess preoperative\nanxiety, which has been reported to promote and exacerbate\nED. However, all children were given ketamine under pa-\nrental supervision prior to surgery to minimize preoperative\nanxiety. Finally, the patients received both interventions were\nincluded in the ITT analysis. The results of the ITT might be\nmore significant but the results of as treated analysis were\nsimilar. Therefore, according to CONSORT guidelines [30], all\nparticipants included in the analysis regardless of adherence\nto the protocol.\n\nIn conclusion, ultrasound guided BPB, which is a good op-\ntion for postoperative acute phase pain control, also contrib-\nutes to reducing the severity and incidence of ED. Based on\nour results, we think that postoperative pain contributes to\nthe development ofED.\n\nKSPA\n\nwww.anesth-pain-med.org\n\n285\n\nAnesth Pain Med Vol. 14 No. 3
