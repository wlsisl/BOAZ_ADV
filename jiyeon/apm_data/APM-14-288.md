INTRODUCTION\n\nrelated to muscarinic receptors are not observed when\nsugammadex is used to reverse rocuronium-induced neu-\nromuscular blockade [1]. However, pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic properties of neuromuscular blockade in\nchildren differ from those in adults due to the larger volume of distribution and the presence of immature neuromuscular\nreceptors [2]. Therefore, studies on the reversal of neuro-\nmuscular block in pediatric patients should be conducted\nseparately from those in adults. A study comparing sugam-\nmadex with neostigmine was recently published [3-5], but\ncomparisons of sugammadex with pyridostigmine in pediatric\nanesthesia are rare. A previous study has compared the effect\nof reversal agents administered at moderate neuromuscular\nblockade (Intense block: post-tetanic count 0 and train-of-four\n[TOF] count 0, Deep block: post-tetanic count ≥ 1 and TOF\ncount 0, Moderate block: TOF count 1-3, Minimal block: TOF\nratio 0.1-0.4, Light block: 0.4 < TOF ratio < 0.9) [6]. However, in\nshort surgery without re-administration of rocuronium, mini-\nmal or light neuromuscular blockade is often observed at the\nend of surgery [6,7].\n\nThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of sugammadex\nand pyridostigmine in reversing light block or minimal block\nin pediatric patients scheduled for elective entropion surgery.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis prospective, randomized study was performed after\nobtaining approval from the ethics committee of Daegu\nFatima Hospital (no. DFH17MRIO335) and obtaining written\nconsent from the person legally responsible for each child.\nSixty healthy pediatric patients, as per the American Society\nof Anesthesiologists physical status classification I/II, aged\n2-11 years and scheduled for entropion surgery were enrolled\nin this study. Exclusion criteria were developmental delays,\nintellectual disability, anxiety disorder, chronic illness (renal\ndisease, liver disease, neuromuscular disease, etc.), previous\nanesthetic experience, known malignanthyperthermia in the\nfamily history, and upper respiratory infection symptom.\n\nRandomization was performed using a random number\ntable generated by Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., USA).\nPatients were classified into 2 groups each on the basis of the\nreversal agent used: sugammadex (Group S) or pyridostig-\nmine plus glycopyrrolate (Group P).\n\nA researcher blinded to the 2 types of reversal agents in\nsyringes containing the same amount (3 ml) injected the re-\nversal agents. An anesthesiologist responsible for TOF moni-\ntoring and data collection was blinded to the administration\nofthe neuromuscular blockade reversal agents.\n\nBoth groups were administered intravenous atropine as\n\npremedication 30 min before surgery. In the operating room,\nbasic monitoring was carried out as follows: electrocar-\ndiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and\ncapnography. Subsequently, ketamine 2 mg/kg was admin-\nistered for induction of general anesthesia. Neuromuscular\nmonitoring was applied after injection of ketamine to avoid\npain in pediatric patients.\n\nNeuromuscular block was monitored with the TOF Watch\nSX (Organon, Ireland) using the acceleromyographic re-\nsponse of the adductor pollicis muscle to repetitive TOF\nstimulation of the ulnar nerve using surface electrodes. The\nperipheral heat sensor was placed on the ventral side of the\nhand. The acceleromyographic transducer was positioned\non the palmar side on the top of the thumb. The monitored\narm was immobilized on the operating table. Stabilization\nwas achieved within 5 s at 50-Hz tetanic stimulation; 1 min\nafter tetanic stimulation, the fingers-excluding the thumb-\nwere fixated and completely immobilized. After 1 min ofTOF\nstimulation, calibration was achieved by pressing the CAL\n2 button. After calibration, supramaximal stimulation was\napplied (current < 60 mA) with square wave pulses of 0.2 ms\nduration that were delivered at 2 Hz at intervals of 15 s during\nsurgery; at the end of surgery the TOF monitor was removed\nafter confirmation ofTOF ratio = 1.0.\n\nAfter the application of neuromuscular monitoring, ro-\ncuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered. Fentanyl 1 �g/kg was\nused for endotracheal intubation in both groups, and dexa-\nmethasone 0.2 mg/kg was administered to prevent postop-\nerative sore throat and spasm. Intubation was performed by\nthe anesthesiologist after confirmation ofTOF count0.\n\nAnesthesia was maintained with a fraction of inspired oxy-\ngen 0.5 and 2-3% sevoflurane. If the surgery was expected to\nlastlonger than 30 min, another bolus dose ofrocuronium 0.2\nmg/kg was administered after the first 40 min. The total dose\nof rocuronium and the time of the last dose of rocuronium\nwere recorded.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, sugammadex 2 mg/kg or the\ncombination of pyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg with glycopyrro-\nlate 0.01 mg/kg was injected after confirming TOF ratio ≥ 0.1\n(minimal to light block) and sevoflurane was discontinued.\nIf neuromuscular blockade degree at the end of surgery was\nTOF count 0-3 (intense to moderate block), sevoflurane was\ncontinued with 0.4 minimum alveolar concentration until\nreappearance of fourth twitch (T4). If the TOF ratio did not reach 0.9 after 10 min of reversal agent administration or\nif postoperative neuromuscular blockade symptoms were\npresent, the rescue dose which is equal to the initial dose was\nadministered. Time of administration of sugammadex or\npyridostigmine-glycopyrolate after last rocuronium admin-\nistration and TOF ratio at that time were recorded. Tracheal\nextubation was performed when TOF ratio > 1.0 and sponta-\nneous ventilation (tidal volume > 5 ml/kg) was maintained\nwith appropriate oxygenation and ventilation as measured\nby breathing capnography, hemodynamic stability, and re-\ncovery ofresponse to verbal commands. Extubation time was\nrecorded. After extubation, each patient was transferred to\nthe post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Propacetamol 30 mg/\nkg mixed with 50 ml normal saline was administered for 20\nmin for postoperative pain control. If the visual analog scale\nscore was ≥ 6 or the patient was agitated or physical restraint\nwas required, fentanyl 1 �g/kg was administered.\n\nPrimary outcomes were time from administration of re-\nversal agents to TOF ratio 0.9 and TOF ratio 1.0. Secondary\noutcomes were time from administration of reversal agent\nto extubation, TOF ratio 0.9 to extubation, time from TOF\nratio 1.0 to extubation, administration of additional reversal\nagents, and adverse events. Adverse events included brady-\ncardia (> 20% decrease from baseline heart rate), tachycardia\n(increased > 20% from baseline heart rate), hypotension\n(mean blood pressure < 50 mmHg), nausea, vomiting, dip-\nlopia, fever, skin rash, dry mouth, and postoperative residual\nneuromuscular blockade in the PACU. Postoperative neu-\nromuscular blockade adverse events included upper airway\nobstruction requiring intervention, hypoxemia (< 94% oxygen\nsaturation), and reintubation.\n\n# Statistical analysis\n\nPower and sample calculators (http://www.powerandsam-\nplesize.com/Calculators/) were used for sample size calcula-\ntion. In a study by Kara et al. [4], recovery time (time to TOF\nratio 0.9) was 0.46 土 0.70 min for the sugammadex group ver-\nsus 1.97 土 2.14 min for the neostigmine group. The suggested\nminimum sample size was 20 per sugammadex group and 20\nper pyridostigmine group at power = 0.9, a = 0.05. Consider-\ning 35% of dropouts and failures, 32 subjects were recruited\nin each group.\n\nStudent's t-tests were used to compare variables that were\n\nnormally distributed such as height, weight, age (month),\nsurgery time, anesthesia time, a dose of rocuronium, the\ninterval from last rocuronium to reversal agent, TOF ratio,\nand time variations. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to\ncompare variables that were not normally distributed such\nas temperature on palm and mid-esophagus. Fisher's exact\nchi-squared tests were used to examine the development of\nadverse events in both groups. All statistical analyses were\nperformed with IBM SPSS statistics version 21.0 (IBM, USA).\nStatistical significance was set at P <0.05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSixty-four subjects were recruited in this study from 1 Sep-\ntember 2017 to 30 June 2018; 4 patients were excluded after\nrefusal by patients' guardians. Patients were classified into 2\ngroups of 30 patients each on the basis of the reversal agent\nused: sugammadex (Group S) or pyridostigmine plus glyco-\npyrrolate (Group P). There were no significant differences in\ndemographic variables between the groups (Table 1.

Mean anes-thesia time was 4.68 min shorter for Group s than for Group P\nbut this difference was not statistically significant.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the postoperative\nresidual neuromuscular blockade. Upper airway obstruc-\ntions after extubation such as bronchospasm and laryngo-\nspasm occurred in 3 patients in Group S and in 7 patients\nin Group P.

However, there\nwas no significant difference in the incidence of upper airway\nobstruction between the two groups.

Two cases of nausea were reported in Group P, but none\nwere reported in Group S; vomiting occurred in 1 patient per\ngroup.

A meta-analysis\nby Guangyu et al. [3] reported that compared to neostigmine\nor a placebo, sugammadex may reverse rocuronium-induced\nneuromuscular blockade more rapidly with comparable\nincidence of adverse events in pediatric patients. However,\nthe included studies used sugammadex to reverse moderate\nor deep neuromuscular blockade and was not available for\nthe shallow block (TOF ratio 0.25 or 0.5). In fact, at the end\nof the surgery, it is common to observe minimal to light neu-\nromuscular blockade as well as a moderate neuromuscular\nblockade. Therefore, we compared sugammadex with the\npyridostigmine used in our institution in minimal to light\nneuromuscular blockade. The onset of action for pyridostig-\nmine is 16 min, which is longer than the 7-11 min for neostig-\nmine [9].\n\nWe expected that the difference in time from administra-\ntion of reversal agent to TOF ratio 0.9 between the sugamma-\ndex group and pyridostigmine group would be greater than\nthat seen in previous studies comparing neostigmine and\nsugammadex (in which the recovery time was up to 5 times\nfaster for sugammadex [5]) and that the frequency of post-\noperative residual neuromuscular blockade would be higher\n[9] because of the delayed onset ofpyridostigmine. The onset\nof action for pyridostigmine is 16 min, which is longer than\nthe 7-11 min for neostigmine [10]. Unexpectedly, our results\nshowed that the time from administration of reversal agent\nto TOF ratio 0.9 and TOF ratio 1.0 were only 2 fold faster in\ncase of sugammadex than pyridostigmine and neither group\nexhibited postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade.\nIn previous studies, additional neuromuscular blockers were\nadministered to maintain a TOF count < 2, and a reversal\nagent was administered when the second twitch (T2) of TOF\nwas observed at the end of the procedure [5,8]. In our study,\nadditional rocuronium was not administered unless the sur-\ngery was expected to continue > 30 min. Additional rocuroni-\num was administered after the first 40 min. As a result, most\npatients, except three, had already reached a light block or\nminimal block state at the end of surgery (with the exception\nof 2 patients in pyridostigmine group who were at T2 and 1\npatientin sugammadex group who was at T0; these 3 patients\nreceived a reversal agent when T4 of TOF appeared). This is\nthe reason there was less difference in the time from adminis-\ntration ofreversal agent to TOF ratio 0.9 between the 2 groups\nthan was observed in the previous study. As in other studies\n\nwhich compared sugammadex and neostigmine in moderate\nblock [5,8,11], use of sugammadex in minimal to light block\nstate induced effective reversal and reduced the time to TOF\nratio 0.9.\n\nKara et al. [4] reported that the time from reversal agent to\nextubation was 2 fold shorter for the sugammadex group. In\nanother study, extubation time was 202.5 (45, 515) s in the\nsugammadex group and 427 (17.5, 720) s in the neostigmine\ngroup [12]. In our study, time from reversal agent to extuba-\ntion was 2 min shorter in the sugammadex group (6.23 土 3.48\nmin) compared with pyridostigmine group (8.58 土 3.89, P =\n0.022). Although the time to extubation was shorter in the\nsugammadex group as in previous studies, the difference was\nsmaller. This is a result of the shallow neuromuscular block-\nade state compared to the previous study. In addition, the\nsynergistic effect of fentanyl and sevoflurane used at induc-\ntion resulted in the extension of extubation time compared\nto a previous study [13]. Further, the difference in extubation\ncriteria may affect extubation time. The mid-esophageal tem-\nperature measured at the end of surgery was normal in both\ngroups, so it did not affect time from TOF 0.9 to extubation\nand time from TOF 1.0 to extubation.\n\nThis study has certain limitations. First, sugammadex is a\ndrug that has not yet been approved by the Korean Food and\nDrug Administration in pediatric patients under 18 years of\nage. Therefore, the study started after the approval of the Ko-\nrean Food and Drug Administration for the research. Further\nstudies are needed to demonstrate the safety of the use of\nsugammadex in pediatric patients. Second, the sample size\nwas obtained from a study comparing sugammadex with\nneostigmine. Third, there was difficulty in finding statistical\ndifferences between the 2 groups in terms of adverse effects\nbecause the number of patients participating in the study\nwas small. Further, dexamethasone administration at induc-\ntion may affect the frequency of nausea, vomiting, and upper\nairway obstruction. Fourth, the sevoflurane concentration\ndata was not collected. Sevoflurane may enhance the effect of\nrocuronium and affect the reversal of rocuronium-induced\nneuromuscular blockade [14]. In addition, it was difficult to\nmeasure adverse events because the subjects were pediat-\nric patients who were not as efficient as adults in reporting\nsymptoms. Even when patients felt dizzy, nauseous, or in\npain, they could not properly express their symptoms, and\nthey exhibited nonspecific symptoms such as restlessness, grimacing, struggling, and crying. The emergence of agitation\nmay be the consequence of other etiologies, including hypox-\nemia, pain, bladder distension, and nausea [15]. Therefore,\nit would be necessary to include the evaluation of postopera-\ntive agitation on the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium\nscale in further studies.\n\nReversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade\nand extubation time were more rapid with sugammadex than\nwith pyridostigmine plus glycopyrrolate in pediatric patients\nundergoing short surgery with surgery time of around 40-60\nmin. Overall differences in anesthesia time were statistically\ninsignificant. There were no statistical differences in frequen-\ncy of adverse events between reversal with sugammadex and\nreversal with pyridostigmine plus glycopyrrolate. In short-\nterm pediatric surgery, sugammadex can be used instead of\npyridostigmine and can be useful when needed for fast rever-\nsal.
