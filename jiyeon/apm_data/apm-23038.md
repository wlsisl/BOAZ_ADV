INTRODUCTION\n\nAny biological process that repeats itself in the body over\napproximately 24 h and maintains this rhythm in the ab-\nsence of external stimuli is referred to as the 'circadian\nrhythm.' The circadian system influences numerous physio-\nlogical variables, such as sleep-wake cycles, body tempera-\nture, heart rate, blood pressure, hormone secretion, metab-\nolism, and the immune system, exhibiting self-sustaining,\nendogenous oscillations [1].

In a meta-analysis of the daily rhythms of pain sensitiv-\nity in healthy individuals, it was observed that pain sensitivi-\nty was highest at the end of the active phase and during the\nnight [4]. However, pain threshold rhythms in humans vary\nsignificantly in response to disease, with sensitivity peaks\nand troughs varying inconsistently across different disease\nstates [5]. Altered pain rhythms manifest inconsistently in\nvarious disease states. In patients with cancer, the peak of breakthrough pain attacks occurs in the late morning/after-\nnoon [6]. Various studies have reported early morning pain\npeaks in patients with fibromyalgia [7] and rheumatoid ar-\nthritis [8]. In contrast, Dekkers et al. [9] did not report any di-\nurnal changes in a rheumatoid arthritis group. Additionally,\ncircadian differences in the efficacy of analgesia, as well as\nthe tolerability of administration during surgical, obstetric,\nand dental procedures, have been observed, with most stud-\nies showing the highest pain sensitivity at night and in the\nearly morning [10-12].\n\nWhile the association between pain states and circadian\nrhythm has been explored in various surgical procedures\nand chronic pain syndromes, there is limited literature in-\nvestigating the relationship between postoperative pain and\ncircadian rhythm in pediatric surgical procedures [13]. Con-\nsequently, this study aims to assess the connection between\npostoperative pain and circadian rhythm following pediatric\nacute appendicitis surgery.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThe study was prospectively planned subsequent to ob-\ntaining approval from the Selcuk University, Faculty Local\nEthics Committee (IRB no. 2022/437) and Clinical Trials\nRegistration (Ref: NCT05379192). It encompassed 200 pa-\ntients, aged 6-18 years, classified with American Society of\nAnesthesiologists physical status I-II, who underwent acute\nappendicitis surgery. Exclusion criteria comprised patients\nmeeting any of the following conditions: American Society\nof Anesthesiologists ≥ III, uncontrolled chronic metabolic\ndisease, opioid use within the last 10 days, history of sepsis,\nabnormal surgery or recovery from anesthesia, those who\nunderwent laparoscopic surgery, and parents unwilling to\nprovide informed consent. Based on the operating hours,\npatients were categorized into four groups: night group\n(01:01-07:00), morning group (07:01-13:00), afternoon\ngroup (13:01-19:00), and evening group (19:01-01:00). De-\nmographic data of the patients, including age, body weight,\nheight, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores,\nand anesthesia and surgery time, were systematically re-\ncorded.\n\nParacetamol (15 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) were\nadministered orally as premedication to patients diagnosed\nwith acute appendicitis, scheduled for an operation to alle-\nviate pain until the procedure. After 3 min of preoxygen-\nation, the standard anesthesia protocol was initiated using\nfentanyl (1 �g/kg) and propofol (2.5 mg/kg), followed by ro-\n\ncuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate anesthesia. A cuffed en-\ndotracheal tube of appropriate size was inserted into the pa-\ntient's trachea. Mechanical ventilation with oxygen-air (40-\n60%) and sevoflurane at 1 minimum alveolar concentration\nwas employed, with intermittent neuromuscular blockade\nusing rocuronium (0.2 mg/kg) if necessary. At the proce-\ndure's conclusion, neuromuscular blockade was antago-\nnized by intravenous injection of sugammadex (4 mg/kg),\nand extubation occurred upon adequate respiration and pa-\ntient responsiveness to commands. Before tracheal extuba-\ntion, the nasogastric tube was aspirated and removed. Intra-\noperative vital signs, including systolic arterial pressure\n(SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pres-\nsure (MAP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2),\nend-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), and temperature, were\nrecorded before surgery, at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min, and\nat the procedure's conclusion.\n\nPerioperative adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting,\nhypotension, bradycardia, tremor, respiratory distress, sore\nthroat, headache, and dizziness, were noted. The routine\nanalgesic protocol, vital signs in the postoperative pediatric\nsurgery ward, the administered amount of analgesic, the du-\nration, and the Wong-Baker Face score (FACEs) values were\nalso recorded. No interventions were made in the routine\nanalgesic protocol.\n\nA visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain,\n10 = worst pain imaginable) was utilized to assess postop-\nerative pain intensity immediately after patients regained\nconsciousness. A FACEs score of2 or lower was considered\nacceptable for patients who experienced restful sleep. In\ninstances of acute pain (FACEs ≥ 3), a rescue medication\nof 10 mg/kg intravenous ibuprofen was administered. Pa-\ntients under observation in the post-anesthesia care unit\nwere transferred to the surgical ward if their FACEs score\nwas below 3 and the modified Aldrete score was above 8.\nNo additional analgesics were administered until a patient\nrequested further pain relief. During the second or subse-\nquent request for analgesia, FACEs pain assessments were\nconducted. In cases where FACEs was greater than 3, an\nadditional analgesic of 10 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of\n1,200 mg/day) intravenous ibuprofen was administered at\n6-h intervals.\n\nPreliminary power analysis was performed using the 'pwr'\npackage in R to test the difference in FACEs between the four\nstudy groups. A medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25) and\nan alpha value of 0.05 were employed for the two-tailed\nanalysis of analysis of variance test. The results showed that a total of 180 participants, divided equally into four groups (n\n= 45), were required to achieve a power of0.80. Considering\na data loss rate of 10%, it was decided to include 50 patients\nin each group.\n\n# RESULTS\n\n# Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analyses were conducted using the R ver-\nsion 3.6.0 statistics package (The R Foundation for Statistical\nComputing, Vienna, Austria; https://www.r-project.org).\nNormality of the data distribution was assessed using Shap-\niro-Wilk's normality test and Q-Q plots. Levene's test was\nemployed to evaluate the homogeneity ofvariances. Numer-\nical variables were reported as mean 土 standard deviation,\nmedian with range (minimum-maximum), or median (in-\nterquartile range) into median (1Q, 3Q). Categorical vari-\nables were presented as counts (n). One-way ANOVA, Pear-\nson's Chi-square test, the Kruskal- Wallis test, and Welch's F\ntest were utilized to investigate potential statistically signifi-\ncant differences or associations between study groups based\non demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients.\nIf the variables were found to be significant with these tests,\nwe performed multiple comparison tests (according to the\nassumption of normality and homogeneity of variances,\nTukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc test after\nANOVA, Games-Howell test after Welch's F test, and Dunn\ntest with Bonferroni correction afterwards). A P value ofless\nthan 5% was considered statistically significant.\n\nWe initially assessed 200 patients for study eligibility; ten\nwere excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, two con-\ntracted coronavirus, and the relatives of two patients de-\nclined participation. Ultimately, 186 patients were included\nand analyzed: 39 in the night group, 52 in the morning\ngroup, 57 in the afternoon group, and 38 in the evening\ngroup.\n\nNo statistically significant differences were observed in the\ndemographic characteristics of the patient groups (Table 1.

The rates of postoperative ad-\nverse effects (postoperative nausea-vomiting, bradycardia,\nand hypotension) were similar among the groups (P > 0.05). \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nMeasurement of cyclical variations in pain perception can\npredict rhythmic changes in the analgesic requirements for\nindividuals undergoing specific types of surgery. Pain relief\ncan be enhanced by manipulating the timing of drug admin-\n\nistration [3]. Our results indicate a circadian change in post-\noperative pain levels in children undergoing appendectomy.\nPatients in the night group (01:01-07:00) experienced higher\nFACEs than those in other circadian periods of the day. Ad-\nditionally, the amount of analgesic required was higher in\nthis group compared to the others. However, FACEs did not show any significant difference among the remaining circa-\ndian periods of the day.\n\nWhile it is challenging to quantify the effects of circadian\nrhythms on humans in a complex clinical setting, factors\nsuch as the stress of anesthesia and surgery, administration\nof anesthetic drugs, and pre-operative fasting can impact the\ninternal clock due to changes like fatigue, sleep deprivation,\nand inactivity, thereby lowering the pain perception thresh-\nold [14-16]. We believe that these factors contributed to the\nelevated pain scores observed in the night group in our\nstudy. However, our results do not seem to align with prior\nstudies on pain processes, which demonstrate anesthesia\nand surgery-induced postoperative processes, associating\ncircadian pain rhythm with higher sensitivity and a higher\npain threshold during nocturnal periods [17,18]. This dis-\ncrepancy may be attributed to cortisol, a potent anti-inflam-\nmatory mediator, contributing to pain reduction by decreas-\ning endogenous proinflammatory cytokine levels [19].\n\nIn clinical practice, opioid analgesics and muscle relaxants\nare often administered alongside hypnotic anesthetic drugs\nfor general anesthesia. In addition to the type of anesthesia,\nthe administration ofhypnotics, opioid analgesics, and mus-\ncle relaxants during general anesthesia in clinical practice\nmay influence the internal clock. This is due to the critical\nrole played by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Y -Ami-\nnobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in regulating the circadian\nclock. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that most anesthetics\nfunction as either NMDA receptor antagonists and/or GABA\nreceptor agonists [20,21]. Auvil-Novak et al. [22] observed\nthat, in humans, the highest and lowest demands for mor-\nphine or hydromorphone occurred in the early morning and\n\novernight, respectively. Boom et al. [23] noted that the de-\nmand for analgesics was highest at 17:30 and lowest during\nthe early morning hours. However, when comparing postop-\nerative fentanyl requirements in a group ofpatients who un-\nderwent elective cholecystectomy at two different times, it\nwas found that the need for fentanyl was lower in patients\nwho had surgery early in the morning (08:00-10:00) com-\npared to those who had surgery later (11:00-15:00) [24]. In\nour study, we demonstrated that postoperative pain levels in\nchildren who underwent an appendectomy were influenced\nby circadian rhythm. According to the circadian periods, the\nFACEs values of the patients in the night group (01:01-07:00)\nwere higher in the first 12 h postoperatively compared to the\nother groups. Additionally, the amount of analgesic required\nwas higher in the night group during the first 12 h postoper-\natively compared to the other groups.\n\nThe clinical studies conducted indicate that the pharma-\ncokinetics of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exhibit\nvariability throughout the day. Specifically, for ketoprofen,\nhigher plasma peaks were observed at 07:00 [25]. In the case\nof indomethacin, earlier and elevated concentrations were\nnoted when administered at 07:00 and 11:00, as opposed to\nother times of the day or night [26]. Controlled-release for-\nmulations of indomethacin and ketoprofen also demon-\nstrated higher and quicker morning absorption in a separate\nstudy [27]. In a study involving healthy volunteers, the\ntime-controlled release formulation of ibuprofen displayed\nlower rates and extents of bioavailability when dosed at\n08:00 compared to dosing at 22:00 [28]. Conversely, immedi-\nate-release ibuprofen tablets did not exhibit any chrono-\npharmacokinetic behavior in the same study. Moreover, an investigation involving intravenous indomethacin injected\ninto sheep revealed that the pharmacokinetics were influ-\nenced by the animal's biological clock [29]. However, there is\ncurrently a lack of chronobiologic data pertaining to the new\ncyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.\n\nInterestingly, some studies have shown that pain scores\nvary significantly throughout the day and are often specific\nto the type of pain experienced [30]. However, pain levels\nhave been observed to differ across studies in relation to the\ncircadian rhythm. Several chronic and maladaptive pain\nconditions are linked to changes in circadian rhythms affect-\ning pain thresholds [31]. These altered pain rhythms mani-\nfest inconsistently across various disease states. The litera-\nture has revealed different connections between \"circadian\nrhythm-pain\" in various clinical situations [7-9,17,18,32-34].\nIn contrast, our results align with the circadian cycle of den-\ntal and rheumatic diseases, which exhibit peak pain levels in\nthe early morning.\n\nPatient conditions are difficult to maintain in clinical tri-\nals, especially when study periods extend for months, pres-\nents significant challenges. Consequently, this study has\nseveral limitations. First, the study groups were not random-\nly assigned but determined based on the hours of surgery,\nleading to an imbalance in the number of study groups. Sec-\nond, most evidence regarding the regulation of pain behav-\nior by circadian rhythms is correlative rather than causative.\nThe mechanisms influencing circadian rhythms may vary\ndue to differences in factors that hospitalized patients are\nexposed to, such as sleep/insomnia, light, noise, and meal\ntimes. Third, anxiety emerges as the most common predic-\ntor of acute postoperative pain [33]. However, measuring\nanxiety levels at the study's outset was not feasible. Fourth,\ngiven potential variations in postoperative pain depending\non the type of appendectomy (laparoscopic vs. open), this\nstudy exclusively included open surgery cases. Furthermore,\nthe study lacked a design or sampling methodology for mea-\nsuring saliva or plasma melatonin and/or cortisol levels. Fi-\nnally, the study's restriction to a single hospital may limit the\ngeneralizability of the data.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate a potential relation-\nship between acute appendicitis surgeries under general an-\nesthesia and the circadian rhythm in children. Pediatric pa-\ntients who underwent surgery between 01:01 and 07:00 ex-\nperienced more pain and required increased postoperative\nanalgesia in the first 12 h compared to patients who under-\nwent surgery at other times of the day. Consequently, we\npropose that a flexible dose adjustment, accounting for cir-\n\ncadian periods, would be highly beneficial in modern indi-\nvidualized pain treatment. This approach could significantly\nenhance patients' quality oflife by minimizing the adverse\neffects of analgesic drugs. However, well-designed and ade-\nquately powered randomized controlled trials investigating\ncircadian pain outcomes for both experimental and clinical\nstudies are imperative.
