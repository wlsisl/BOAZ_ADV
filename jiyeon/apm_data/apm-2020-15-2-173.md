INTRODUCTION\n\nAppropriate airway management is critical in the pediat-\nric population with a lower oxygen reserve. Supraglottic\nairway devices (SADs) have been used to secure and main-\ntain airways in patients during surgery or emergency situa-\ntions, as well as in the management of expected and unex-\n\npected difficult airways. Among various SADs, the i-gelTM\n(Inter-surgical Ltd., UK) which has a soft non-inflatable\ncuff and a gastric access port, has been widely used in chil-\ndren. According to a recent meta-analysis, the i-gel has a\nhigh oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) and a low risk of\nblood staining, compared with LMA �-Classic [1].\n\nAnother device, Ambu AuraGain TM (Ambu, Denmark), a recently released second-generation SAD, has an inflatable\ncuff and a gastric port. One of the key features of the Au-\nraGain is the 90-degree angulated shaft, following the anat-\nomy of the upper airway, which facilitates proper insertion\nand is associated with a high success rate for insertion [2,3].\nAlthough use of the AuraGain has increased, research re-\ngarding its clinical performance is limited, especially\namong children [4,5].\n\nThere has been some reports comparing use of the Au-\nraGain and i-gel in pediatric patients, which concluded that\nthe i-gel may be superior to the AuraGain in terms of OLP\n[5,6]. However, the incidence of additional manipulation or\ndevice failure which was defined as the abandonment of the\nSAD and replacement with a tracheal tube or another device\nwas higher for the i-gel than for other SADs, which should be\nevaluated further in pediatric populations [1,6]. In addition,\nthere is limited evidence in paralyzed children. Therefore, in\nthis study, we hypothesized that the clinical performance of\nthe AuraGain would be comparable to that of the i-gel in the\npediatric populations.\n\nThe objective of this prospective, randomized trial was to\ncompare the clinical performance of the AuraGain and\ni-gel in terms of OLP, successful insertion, ventialtion qual-\nity, ease of suction catheter placement, additional manipu-\nlation after insertion, and complications in children under\ngeneral anesthesia.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n# Ethics and study population\n\nThis prospective randomized, controlled, parallel-de-\nsigned trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board\n(no. H1704-083-846) and registered at http://clinicaltrials.\ngov (no. NCT03118245). The study was performed in accor-\ndance with the ethical standards set forth in the 1964 Decla-\nration of Helsinki and its later amendments. One day before\nsurgery, an anesthesiologist met with each child's parents,\nexplained the study protocol, and obtained written informed\nconsent from them.\n\nChildren aged between 1 month and 7 years who were\nscheduled for simple superficial or peripheral limb surgery\nwithin 2 h, under general anesthesia, were enrolled in this\nstudy. Children with American society of anesthesiologist\nphysical status over than II, recent upper respiratory tract\ninfection, any respiratory disease, a history of cervical dis-\norder or surgery, risk factors for aspiration including insuf-\n\nficient fasting times, difficult airways, or body mass indices\n> 30 kg/m2 were excluded from this study. In addition,\nchildren who were scheduled for emergency surgery, ab-\ndominal or thoracic surgeries and all laparoscopic proce-\ndures were also excluded.\n\nGroup allocation\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to one of two groups,\nthe i-gel group or the AuraGain group, using a stratified\nrandomization procedure (computerized random number;\nhttp://www.randomizer.org). The allocation ratio was 1 : 1,\nand an anesthetic nurse who was not associated with the\nstudy performed the random allocation by preparing cod-\ned and sealed opaque envelopes for allocation conceal-\nment. The patients were blinded to group allocation. The\nbedside anesthesiologists, however, were not blinded.\n\nAnesthesia and study protocol\n\nBefore induction of anesthesia, all pediatric patients\nwere sedated with intravenous thiopental sodium (5 mg/\nkg) or propofol (2 mg/kg) and were taken to the operating\nroom. After electrocardiographic monitoring, pulse oxygen\nsaturation and non-invasive blood pressure measurement\nwere initiated, and anesthesia was induced with sevoflu-\nrane 4-6 vol% in 100% oxygen. Following muscle relaxation\nwith rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) and mask ventilation for 90 s,\nthe i-gel or deflated AuraGain which were lubricated with\n2% lidocaine jelly was gently inserted into the oropharynx\nby a single experienced anesthesiologist (L.J.H), according\nto group allocation. The sizes of the AuraGain and i-gel\nwere selected based on body weight, as suggested by the\nmanufacturer as follows: size 1.5 (for 5-12 kg), 2 (10-25 kg),\nand 2.5 (25-35 kg) for the i-gel; size 1.5 (5-10 kg), 2 (10-20\nkg), and 2.5 (20-30 kg) for the AuraGain.\n\nAfter insertion, the cuff of the AuraGain was inflated to an\nintracuff pressure of 40 cmH2O using a Portex� cuff inflator\n(Smiths Medical, USA). Mechanical ventilation was started,\nand adequate ventilation was confirmed by square-wave\ncapnography and bilateral chest excursion. When adequate\nventilation was not achieved, the SAD was removed and re-\ninserted. Up to three insertion attempts were allowed. Tra-\ncheal intubation was planned in cases of three failed inser-\ntion attempts, and such patients were subsequently exclud-\ned from the study. During insertion of the SAD, the patient's\nhead and neck were left in the neutral position with the face straight up and the Frankfort plane angled at approxi-\nmately 70-80 degrees to the horizontal plane of the bed, as\ndescribed by Kobayashi et al. [7]. Mechanical ventilation\nwas started in the volume-controlled mode, with a tidal\nvolume of 8 ml/kg, and the respiratory rate was adjusted to\nmaintain ETCO2 of35-40 mmHg. Sevoflurane in an air-oxy-\ngen mixture, with fractional inspired O2 at 40%, was used to\nmaintain anesthesia at a targeted Bispectral index of 40-60.\n\nImmediately after insertion, OLP was determined by\nclosing the adjustable pressure limiting valve of the breath-\ning circuit, with a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min [8,9]. While in-\ncreasing the airway pressure up to 40 cmH2O, oropharyn-\ngeal leak was assessed by placing the stethoscope over the\npatient's neck, immediately lateral to the thyroid cartilage.\nOLP was re-assessed 10 min after insertion.\n\nAfter determination of the OLP, fiberoptic views were ob-\ntained by a single anesthesiologist (L.J.H) by placement of\na fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus LF-DP, Olympus Cor-\nporation, Japan) through the SAD. The view was scored us-\ning the Okuda score as follows [10]: 1) the view was com-\npletely covered by the anterior epiglottis, but SAD function\nwas adequate, 2) the anterior epiglottis covered more than\ntwo-thirds of the diameter of the view, 3) the anterior epi-\nglottis covered one-third to two-thirds of the diameter of\nthe view, and 4) the anterior epiglottis covered less than\none-third of the diameter of the view.\n\nNext, a lubricated suction catheter was inserted through\nthe drainage port each SAD for gastric decompression. The\nsize of suction catheter was selected according to allowable\nmaximal catheter size, as suggested by the manufacturer as\nfollows: 10 Fr for size 1.5, 2 and 2.5 of the i-gel; 8 Fr for size\n1.5, and 10 Fr for size 2 and 2.5 of the AuraGain. The ease of\nplacement of the suction catheter was assessed as follows:\n1) easy - suction catheter enters without resistance at once,\n2) difficult - suction catheter withdrawal and re-insertion\nare tried more than once due to resistance, and 3) suction\ncatheter is unable to pass.\n\nVentilation quality was assessed by auscultating the lung\nsound and evaluating the waveform of capnography and\nbilateral chest excursion [11] as follows: 1) clear, 2) mini-\nmal obstruction, 3) partial obstruction, and 4) complete\nobstruction. If ventilation was inadequate, additional ma-\nnipulations were performed, which included gentle push-\ning or pulling of the device, lifting of the chin, jaw thrust-\ning, or head and neck re-positioning. The additional ma-\nnipulation required was recorded.\n\nThe occurrence of complications during surgery and the\n\nemergence period were recorded. These included desatu-\nration (SpO2 < 90%), bronchospasm, laryngospasm,\ncoughing, aspiration and bleeding or blood stain on the\nSAD.\n\nOutcomes and statistical analysis\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was the OLP mea-\nsured immediately after insertion. The secondary out-\ncomes were OLP 10 min after insertion, first-attempt suc-\ncess rate and total success rate for insertion, number of at-\ntempts at and ease of suction catheter placement, peak in-\nspiratory pressure, fiberoptic bronchoscopic view score,\nventilation quality, requirement of additional manipula-\ntion after insertion, and complications.\n\nThe required sample size of the present study was deter-\nmined based on a previous pediatric study, which compared\nthe performance of the AuraOnce and the i-gel [12]. The\nmean OLP was 22 土 5 cmH2O with the i-gel and 19 土 3 cm-\nH2O with the AuraOnce. Thus, the sample size required for\nthe present study was determined to be approximately 41\npatients per group, with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power\nof0.9, using PASS 2008 software (ver. 8.0.16; NCSS statistical\nsoftware, USA). A total of 98 patients were required, consid-\nering an attrition rate of about 20%.\n\nAll data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (ver. 23.0;\nIBM Co., USA). Normality of data distribution was assessed\nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical variables\nwere expressed as numbers and percentages, and continu-\nous variables were expressed as means 土 standard devia-\ntions (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges. The chi-\nsquare test was used to test categorical data significance,\nand Fisher's exact test was used when the expected count\nof > 20% cells was less than five. Student's t-test or the\nMann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to determine the\nsignificance of continuous data. A P value of < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFrom April 2017 to January 2018, 98 pediatric patients\nwere screened and 4 patients who did not meet the inclu-\nsion criteria were excluded. Ninety-four pediatric patients\nwere enrolled in the study and randomly allocated to two\ngroups. Among them, one patient from the AuraGain group\nwas excluded because of failure to obtain respiratory data.\nThus, data from 93 children (46 in the AuraGain group and 47 in the i-gel group) were analyzed (\nEnrollment\nAssessed for eligibility (n = 98)\nExcluded (n = 4)\n· Not meeting inclusion criteria (n = 4)\n· Declined to participate (n = 0)\nOther reasons (n = 0)\nRandomized (n = 94)\nAllocation\nAllocated to AuraGain group (n = 47) Allocated to i-gel group (n = 47)\nReceived allocated intervention (n = 47) · Received allocated intervention (n = 47)\n· Did not receive allocated intervention (n = 0) · Did not receive allocated intervention (n = 0)\nFollow-up\nDiscontinued intervention (failure to data Lost to follow-up (n = 0)\nacquistion) (n = 1) Discontinued intervention (n = 0)\nAnalysis\nAnalysed (n = 46) Analysed (n = 47)\nExculded from analysis (n = 0) Exculded from analysis (n= 0)\n\nFig. 1.

In addi-\ntion, post-10-min OLP did not differ statistically, between\nthe AuraGain (30.2 土 7.1 cmH2O) and i-gel group (28.1 土\n7.9 cmH2O; mean difference [95% CI], 2.2 [-1.0 to 5.4] cm-\nH2O; P = 0.182). The OLP was significantly increased by 10\nmin after insertion in both the AuraGain group (mean dif-\nferences [95% CI], 2.4 [0.5 to 4.3]; P = 0.016) and the i-gel\ngroup (mean differences [95% CI], 3.4 [2.0 to 4.8]; P <\n0.001) (Table 2).\n\nWe did not experience insertion failure in either group.\nBoth the AuraGain and i-gel were inserted successfully\nwithin two attempts in all participants. The initial success rates of AuraGain and i-gel insertion were 93.5% and 100%\n(mean difference [95% CI], 6.5 [-2.2 to 17.5]%, P = 0.071),\nrespectively. After each SAD insertion, gastric suction cath-\neter insertion was attempted in all patients ofthe AuraGain\ngroup and 44 of 47 patients of i-gel group. The suction\ncatheter was not passed in one patient from each group.\nNumber of patients with difficult suction catheter insertion\nwas one in the AuraGain group while eight in the i-gel\ngroup (Table 2.

In six patients in\nthe i-gel group, the laryngeal structures could not be seen\nowing to the epiglottis. In addition, four of the i-gel partici-\npants (8.5%) required additional intraoperative manipula-\ntion, including optimization ofhead position and change in\nthe insertion depth of the SAD, as the tidal volume de-\ncreased significantly due to airway leak. In contrast, the Au-\nraGain group did not require additional external manipula-\ntions to maintain adequate ventilation (8.5% vs. 0%; mean\ndifference [95% CI], 8.5 [-0.7 to 20.0]%, P = 0.038) (Table 3.

Complications in the\ni-gel group included laryngospasm, coughing, breath-hold-\ning, and desaturation (< 90%). However, none of these cases\nrequired additional management procedures such as tra-\ncheal intubation. One child had a blood stain on the Au-\nraGain after removal.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of\nthe AuraGain and i-gel in children aged between 1 month\nand 7 years, who were undergoing simple surgical proce-\ndures. To compare the efficacy of the AuraGain and i-gel,\nOLP was measured at initial device placement and 10 min af-\nter placement. There were no significant differences in the\ninitial or the post-10-min OLP between the two groups. In ad-\ndition, ventilation quality was comparable between two SADs.\nHowever, the i-gel required more additional manipulation af-\nter insertion, provided a poorer fiberoptic bronchoscopic nview, and was associated with more difficulty in placing the\nsuction catheter in children.\n\nThe results of the present study regarding OLP differ\nfrom that of recent, previous studies [5,6]. According Miha-\nra et al.[5] and Kim et al.[6], the OLP ofi-gel was about 23\ncmH2O immediately after insertion, which was similar to\nour results, and it was significantly higher than the OLP of\nthe AuraGain, which was 17-18 cmH2O [5]. However, in our\ntrial, the OLP of the AuraGain group immediately after in-\nsertion was 27.5 cmH2O. In addition, our previous study\nevaluating the performance of AuraGain at different head\nand neck position, the OLP in the neutral position was 26\ncmH2O [13].\n\nThere are some possible explanations for the differing re-\nsults between our trial and the previous study. First, the in-\ntracuff pressure of the AuraGain in our trial was 40 cmH2O,\nwhereas it was 30 cmH2O in the Mihara et al.'s study [5]. On\nthe other hand, there was no information about an intracuff\npressure for AuraGain in Kim et al's study [6]. The informa-\ntion about intracuff pressure is important to compare the\nOLP, because adequate cuff pressure was associated with\nhigher OLP [14]. Second, we used a neuromuscular blocker\nthat could relax the pharyngeal muscle and improve the air-\nway seal by the AuraGain. In Mihara et al's study [5], more\nthan half of the children maintained spontaneous ventila-\ntion or were ventilated by pressure support ventilation. In\naddition, no neuromuscular blockade was used in Kim et\nal's study [6]. The effect of neuromuscular blockade on OLP\nis different among the SADs [15,16]. However, the evidence\nis limited regarding OLP with AuraGain and i-gel in para-\nlyzed children. We speculated that the AuraGain could pro-\nvide adequate airway sealing pressure in paralyzed children\nunder positive pressure ventilation.\n\nInterestingly, the OLP of both devices improved during\nthe early anesthesia period. This suggests that both devices\nhave the ability to sustain a stable laryngeal seal during the\ninitial phase of anesthetic maintenance. There are reports\nthat there might be a chronological improvement in the\nOLP [17]. However, the reason for the increase in OLP is\nunclear. There has been some speculation about this phe-\nnomenon; it has been suggested that this might be due to\nthe thermoplastic properties of the gel cuff [18], or that\nsome degree of molding of the device in the posterior\npharynx improves the airway seal [19]. In addition, saliva\nmay improve the sealing due to the adhesive properties of\nliquids.\n\nThe overall insertion success rate within the first two at-\n\ntempts was 100% for both the AuraGain and i-gel. The first-at-\ntempt success rates for AuraGain and i-gel insertion were\n93.5% and 100%, respectively. This finding was in concor-\ndance with previous findings [4,20,21]. In this study, four pa-\ntients in the i-gel group (8.3%) required additional manipula-\ntions during surgery, because the tidal volume could not be\nadequately achieved, whereas no patients in the AuraGain\ngroup required additional manipulations. For two patients,\nthei-gel had to be inserted deeper and fixed with additional\ntape, as it was dislodged from its initial position. Another\ntwo patients required head and neck extension to achieve\nan adequate tidal volume. Previously published studies in-\ndicated that the i-gel tends to slide out and requires addi-\ntional manipulations [12,22,23]. Accoriding to Kim et al.\n[23], approximately 33% of pediatric patients required ad-\nditional manipulations which was mainly further insertion\nof the i-gel. Hughes et al. [22] reported that the elastic char-\nacteristics of the i-gel may contribute to its instability upon\ninsertion and cause it to slip out. We speculate that this prob-\nlem occurs more commonly in children than in adults, be-\ncause of the unique anatomical features of children. The pe-\ndiatric i-gel is a smaller version of the adult model, but the\nchild's upper airway anatomy is not a mere miniature version\nof an adult's anatomy. The key differentiating features of a\nchild's upper airway are a larger tongue in proportion to the\nmouth, a smaller pharynx, a larger and more flaccid epiglottis,\nan anterior and superior positioned larynx, and a conical\nshaped larynx [24]. Even though the manufacturer claims that\nthe i-gel is anatomically designed to seal the larynx, pediatric\nanatomical features may not have been taken into account in\nits conception. Unlike the i-gel, the AuraGain has a pro-\nnounced angulation, a feature that makes it less prone to slid-\ning out and stabilizes its position upon insertion [2,12].\n\nThe initial success rate for gastric suction catheter inser-\ntion was significantly lower in the i-gel group than in the\nAuraGain group. The suction catheter placement in the\ni-gel was significantly more difficult than in the AuraGain,\nsubjectively. This may be due to the relative instability of\nthe i-gel in the hypopharyngeal space. The i-gel's tendency\nto rotate and slip out from the mouth may displace the gas-\ntric channel inlet away from the opening of the esophagus\nand make it difficult for the gastric suction catheter to pass\nthrough.\n\nThe fiberoptic bronchoscopic view score for the Au-\nraGain was markedly better than that for the i-gel. It\ndemonstrated a complete or partial view of the vocal cord\nin 87.2% of the i-gel group and 100% of the AuraGain group. A recent study reported a similar result that regard-\nless ofsize, AuraGain provided a better fiberoptic view than\ni-gel in pediatric patients [6]. This observation can be ex-\nplained by the 90-degree tube angle of the AuraGain,\nwhich may lift up the tongue base, improving the view of\nthe larynx and allowing the fiberoptic bronchoscope to ap-\nproach closer, at a more acute angle, to the vocal cord. In\ncontrast, the i-gel was more frequently rotated with respect\nto the pharyngeal structure, which makes it difficult for the\nobserver to view the hypopharynx structures [12]. Addi-\ntionally, epiglottic downfolding may be more common\nwith the i-gel, particularly in children [22]. Ventilation\nquality remained the same between the AuraGain and i-gel\ngroups. However, in terms of using SADs as an intubation\nconduit during difficult airway management, the poor fi-\nberoptic view provided by the i-gel may make it a less fa-\nvorable choice compared to the AuraGain.\n\nIn this study, adverse events were rare in both groups. A\ncomplication occurred in one patient (2.2%) from the Au-\nraGain group and in four patients (10.8%) from the i-gel\ngroup. This is a much lower complication rate than that re-\nported in previous studies (11-42%) [25-27]. Although it\nwas not statistically significant, the complication rate was\nrelatively higher in the i-gel group. We speculate that the\nadditional manipulation required in the i-gel group may\nhave irritated the upper airway and caused complications\nduring the emergence period. Further studies are required\nto validate this relationship.\n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be mentioned.\nFirst, the sample size was calculated from a previous study\nthat evaluated a different SAD, the AuraOnce, which has a\nsignificantly lower OLP compared with the AuraGain in the\npresent study and other recent studies [12,28]. Second,\nthose measuring the outcomes were not blinded to group\nallocation because it was impossible to blind them to the\nSAD used. Third, we used a muscle relaxant in all children,\nwhich might be a limitation in generalizing our results to\nall anaesthetized children. However, it can provide new\ndata for the evaluation of SADs in this specific population.\nFinally, we did not perform intubation through the SADs.\nWe speculated that the AuraGain may be a better intuba-\ntion conduit than the i-gel, because of the better fiberoptic\nview score, but further studies are required to validate this\ntheory.\n\nIn summary, both the AuraGain and i-gel provided com-\nparable oropharyngeal sealing and ventilation quality in\nchildren receiving neuromuscular blockers during anes-\n\nthesia. However, the i-gel required additional manipulation\nafter insertion, which might be associated with a higher in-\ncidence of complication. In addition, the fiberoptic view\nscore and ease of suction catheter placement through the\ngastric port were better with the AuraGain. Therefore, the\nAuraGain is more favorable than the i-gel for use in pediat-\nric patients under general anesthesia.
