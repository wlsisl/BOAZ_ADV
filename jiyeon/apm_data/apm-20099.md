Central venous catheterization is frequently performed\nduring general anesthesia, mainly for fluid administration\nand monitoring of central venous pressure. In addition, the\nneed for frequent blood sampling can also be a reason for\ncentral venous catheterization to reduce the pain or fear of\nneedle insertion. Since pediatric patients with moyamoya\ndisease (MMD) are at risk ofischemic attack when crying or\nundergoing physical or emotional stress, a central venous\n\nUltrasound-guided insertion of peripherally\ninserted central catheter after anesthetic\ninduction in children undergoing surgery for\nmoyamoya disease\n- Thirty cases report -\n\nSang-Hwan Ji', Sol Ji Yoo' Sung-Ae Cho2, Young-Eun Jang1\nEun-Hee Kim1 Ji-Hyun Lee1 Jin-Tae Kim . and Hee-Soo Kim 1,3\n,\n\n'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital,\nSeoul, 2Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Konyang University Hospital,\nDaejeon, 3Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University\nCollege of Medicine, Seoul, Korea\n\nBackground: Pediatric patients with moyamoya disease are vulnerable to ischemic attacks\nfollowing physical or emotional stress, such as those experienced during blood sampling. A\ncentral venous catheter might be beneficial for blood sampling, and a peripherally inserted\ncentral catheter (PICC) is a considerable option for central venous access. However, PICC in-\nsertion during anesthetic management is relatively rare.\n\nCase: Thirty cases of ultrasound-guided PICC insertion were performed in children undergo-\ning surgery for moyamoya disease after anesthetic induction. Positioning was successful in\n22 cases, and 5 were malpositioned. In three cases, the peripheral insertion failed. Adjust-\nment of the insertion depth was performed in nine cases. No complications related to cath-\neterization were observed during the procedure or the catheter indwelling period.\n\nConclusions: We report the successful use of PICC in children undergoing surgery for moy-\namoya disease with a considerable success rate and low incidence of malpositioning or\ncomplications.\n\nKeywords: Children; General anesthesia; Central venous catheterization; Moyamoya dis-\nease; Neurosurgery; Ultrasonography.\n\ncatheter would be helpful for postoperative blood sampling\nor fluid management to prevent these events.\n\nA peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a good\noption for central venous access [1] with good compliance,\nlow complication rate [2,3], and readiness for ambulation af-\nter surgery, compared to the internal jugular or subclavian\nveins. However, it is rarely selected by anesthesiologists in\nthe operating room. While PICC can be inserted at the bed side or under fluoroscopic guidance prior to surgery for\nadults, PICC insertion for pediatric patients is not easy, and\nthey require sedation for the procedure in most cases. Under\ngeneral anesthesia, ultrasound is readily applicable to pedi-\natric patients without causing radiation hazards compared\nto fluoroscopy, which is frequently used as a guide for PICC\ninsertion.\n\nWe recently introduced a policy to insert the PICC under\nultrasound guidance after induction of general anesthesia in\npediatric patients undergoing surgery for MMD. We report\nour cases along with a summary of the success and compli-\ncation rates.\n\n# CASE REPORT\n\n# Ethics statement\n\nThis report was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of Seoul National University Hospital (no. 2004-231-\n1119), and the requirement for obtaining informed consent\nwas waived. The reason for the exemption from consent was\nas follows: First, obtaining informed consent from the pa-\ntients was not feasible because they had already been dis-\ncharged from the hospital at the moment we started to re-\nview the cases. Second, there was no reason to assume dis-\nagreement regarding the use of data from the patients, and\nthere was no chance of affecting any of the patients' treat-\nment or prognosis.\n\n# Study population\n\nWe reviewed 30 cases of ultrasound-guided PICC inser-\ntion after anesthetic induction in pediatric patients under-\ngoing surgery for MMD between January 2020 and April\n2020. The baseline characteristics are shown in (Table 1.

Sev-\nenteen (56.7%) patients had previously undergone neuro-\nsurgery with central venous catheterization using one of the\ninternal jugular veins. Patients with connective tissue dis-\nease or vascular disease other than MMD, any skin lesion in\nthe upper extremity, and unstable vital signs on anesthetic\ninduction were excluded from the PICC insertion.\n\n# Catheter insertion technique\n\nAfter conventional induction of general anesthesia, the\npatient was positioned for PICC insertion in the supine posi-\ntion, and the right upper arm was abducted [4]. After posi-\n\ntioning, the basilic or cephalic vein was evaluated using an\nultrasound device (E-CUBE i7, Alpinion Medical Systems\nCo., Ltd., Korea or Sonosite X-Porte, Fujifilm Sonosite, Inc.,\nUSA) to select the venipuncture site. If the basilic vein was\nselected, the elbow was flexed at 90°, while it was extended\nto the cephalic vein. The patient's right arm was covered\nwith a surgical drape after sterilization. Turbo-Ject� pow-\ner-injectable PICC (Cook Medical LLC, USA) with a size of3\nor 4 Fr was prepared. Even though 4-Fr catheters are recom-\nmended for veins larger than 4 mm in diameter [5], a larger\ncatheter size may be related to a higher risk of thrombosis\n[6]. In most cases, we used 3-Fr catheters in an effort to use a\ncatheter as small as possible to prevent thrombosis. Cathe-\nters sized 4 Fr were used only for patients weighing > 70 kg.\nBefore venipuncture, the length of catheter insertion was\ndetermined by measuring the distance between the targeted\nvenipuncture site and the sternal notch [7]. The catheter was\nthen trimmed according to the required length. The targeted\nvein was punctured under ultrasound guidance, followed by\nthe insertion of a 20-gauge intravenous BD angiocath TM\n(Becton, Dickinson, and company Korea, Korea) catheter. To\nensure stability, we tried to maintain a distance of at least 4\ncm between the antecubital fossa and venipuncture site [8].\nSubsequently, a guidewire was inserted via an intravenous\ncatheter. An introducer was inserted along the guidewire af-\nter a minimal skin incision was made at the venipuncture\nsite. After removal of the guidewire, the PICC was inserted\nthrough the introducer and advanced until the entire cathe-\nter was inserted. During the advancement of the catheter, the patient's head was turned to the ipsilateral side. The arm\nwas then moved cephalad in an effort to facilitate successful\ninsertion [9]. The function of the PICC was tested by aspira-\ntion of blood and flushing with normal saline through the\ncatheter.\n\nConfirmation of the catheter tip\n\nImmediately after insertion of the catheter, the right inter-\nnal jugular vein was traced using ultrasound to confirm that\nthe catheter did not enter the right internal jugular vein.\nWhen the catheter was observed in the right internal jugular\nvein, the catheter was withdrawn slightly and then reinsert-\ned until the catheter was completely inserted but not visible\nin the right internal jugular vein. If possible, the right subcla-\nvian vein was also visualized to ensure that the catheter had\nnot migrated into the right innominate vein.\n\nAfter the end of the surgery, the position of the tip of the\ncatheter was checked via chest radiography (CXR) at the in-\ntensive care unit or the post-anesthesia care unit. The tip\nposition was classified into three categories: \"Optimal\" for\nthose located within a 3-cm margin from the cavo-atrial\njunction, \"suboptimal\" if they were within the superior vena\ncava (SVC) or the right atrium, but located outside the 3-cm\nmargin from the cavo-atrial junction, or \"malpositioned\" in\ncases involving vessels at locations other than the SVC [10].\nWe defined success as the optimal or suboptimal position of\nthe catheter tip in the postoperative CXR.\n\n# Statistical analysis\n\nDemographic data, history of previous surgery, vein se-\nlected for puncture, depth from skin and diameter of the\nselected vein, determined insertion length of the catheter,\nthe success rate at the first attempt, overall success rate,\nnumber of insertion attempts, reasons for failed attempts,\npostoperative repositioning of the catheter, duration of\npostoperative catheter indwelling, and functioning of the\ncatheter were reviewed. Immediate and long-term compli-\ncations, including hematoma formation, thrombosis, in-\nfection, insertion site oozing, skin reactions, and catheter\nmigration, were also reviewed. The Pearson correlation CO-\nefficient between the patient height and the determined\ninsertion length of the catheter was calculated. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using SPSS� statistics version\n23.0 (IBM, USA).\n\nOutcomes of PICC insertion\n\nAmong the 30 patients, the procedure was completed in\n27 (90.0%) patients, while we failed to introduce the catheter\nin the other 3 patients. Twenty-two (73.3%) cases showed\nsuccessful PICC with optimal or suboptimal positioning of\nthe catheter tip on confirmation with CXR. Insertion was\nsuccessful in the first attempt in 19 patients. Detailed infor-\nmation on the insertion attempts is presented in Table 2(Table 2.

SFailed to insert the catheter.).\n\nUpon confirmation with postoperative CXRs for the com-\npleted cases, 5 (16.7%) cases showed malpositioning of the\ncatheter, 3 in the right internal jugular vein, and 2 in the left\nbrachiocephalic vein. (Fig. 1. Examples of postoperative chest radiographs for confirmation of the tip of peripherally inserted central catheters. The tip is located\nat the superior vena cava (A), ipsilateral internaljugular vein (B), and contralateral brachiocephalic vein (C).)Fig. 1 shows examples of CXRs for the\nsuccessful placement and malpositioning of the catheter tip.\nAmong the malpositioned cases, the basilic vein was select-\ned in four cases and the cephalic vein was selected in one\ncase. In one case of malpositioning of the internal jugular\nvein, the PICC was revised in the angiography room the day\nafter. In another case of malpositioning of the internal jugu-\nlar vein, the catheter was withdrawn by 4 cm. In the remain-\ning 3 malpositioned cases, the catheter was used without re-\npositioning. In 6 cases, the catheter tip was located deeper\nthan expected. In these cases, the catheter was withdrawn\nby a median (1Q, 3Q) of 3.8 (3.1, 5.5) cm. Two of the with-\ndrawn cases involved follow-up CXRs, which confirmed the\nwithdrawal of the catheter to the proximal end of the right subclavian vein. In one case, the insertion length was short-\ner than expected to an extent of 5 cm, and there was no ad-\njustment.\n\nIn 3 patients, the catheter was unexpectedly withdrawn\nduring transportation ofthe patient from the operating room\nto the intensive care unit, while re-insertion of the catheter\nwas not performed. All successful cases showed intact cath-\neter function, with no reported immediate complications\nsuch as hematoma, thrombosis, skin irritation, or bleeding.\n\nThe median (1Q, 3Q) duration of indwelling was 7 (6, 8)\ndays, and the total indwelling time for all subjects was 184\nPICC-days with no reported complications or complaints of\ndiscomfort. There was a strong positive correlation between\nthe patient's height and the insertion length of the catheter,\nwith a Pearson correlation coefficient of0.906 (P < 0.001).\n\nFour patients were included twice in our data, and all\nshowed successful insertion during the first operation. In\nthe second operation, the four cases showed a failure of\nPICC insertion, malpositioning to the contralateral side, suc-\ncessful insertion in the same vein, and successful insertion\nin the alternate vein (cephalic-basilic).\n\nWe did not survey patient satisfaction with PICC after sur-\ngery. However, neurosurgeons in charge of their in-hospital\ncare reported an overall increase in patients' comfort and\nstability during the hospital stay with PICC compared to ac-\ncess via the internal jugular or subclavian veins.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe summarized cases of PICC insertion under ultrasound\n\nguidance after induction of general anesthesia in pediatric\npatients undergoing surgery for MMD with successful posi-\ntioning ofthe catheter tip in 22 out of30 cases.\n\nIn recent studies, success rates defined as proper position-\ning of the PICC catheter with ultrasound-guided insertion\nhave been reported to be about 81.2% and 94.4% [10,11] in\nadults and 83.9% [12] in children. Our success rate of 73.3%\nwas relatively lower than these results. In our cases, catheter\ninsertion was performed during anesthesia and prior to sur-\ngery. As we just introduced the policy of PICC insertion in\nour department, the proficiency of the practitioner might be\na cause for the lower success rate. Moreover, since we re-\nviewed only a small number of cases, the success rate may be\ninconsistent with previous data. Among the three cases of\nfailed insertion, it was difficult to advance the catheter into\nthe right subclavian vein with or without the obturator in two\ncases, and advancement of the introducer was impossible in\nthe other case. Reports of common reasons for PICC inser-\ntion failure are difficult to find in the literature, so we could\nnot compare our results with those of previous studies.\n\nThe incidence of malpositioning of the catheter tip is re-\nported to be higher with ultrasound guidance than with fluo-\nroscopic guidance [13] and varies from 8.4% to 27% [10,13]. In\nour study, the malpositioning rate of the inserted cases was\n18.5%, which is consistent with these results. Although we\nchecked via ultrasound immediately after catheter placement,\nupper limb PICC in children may move with arm movement\nto an extent of2.2 rib spaces [14], which can be an explanation\nfor this malpositioning. Abduction of the right upper arm\nduring the procedure might have affected the migration ofthe catheter tip since the arm was abducted during the surgery\nand immediate postoperative period. We might have had a\nbetter agreement between CXR and ultrasound if CXR was\nchecked immediately after insertion. However, since we want-\ned to avoid exposing patients to additional radiation, we de-\ncided not to check CXR immediately, but to rely on ultra-\nsound and routine postoperative CXR. This was possible be-\ncause our primary reason for PICC insertion was acquiring a\nstable route of blood sampling and fluid administration, but\nnotmonitoring the central venous pressure.\n\nImmediate complications associated with PICC insertion\nare reported to be rare, with a global complication rate of\n30.2% during indwelling and 11.1 per 1000 PICC-days [15].\nIn our study group, there were no records of any complica-\ntions associated with PICC. In contrast, in our previous\nstudy, patients maintained the PICC for a median of17 days,\nranging from 2 to 174 days [15], and the meantime to the on-\nset of complications was 16.1 days. The relatively short cath-\neter maintenance period may have affected our complica-\ntion-free outcomes. In three cases, however, accidental\nwithdrawal of the catheter occurred during transportation of\nthe patient, which indicated the need for more caution.\n\nAlthough some reports have described landmark-based\ndetermination of PICC insertion length, they are limited to\nadults [7]. Since there is no standardized method to deter-\nmine the appropriate length of PICC insertion in children\nand no fluoroscopy was available, we simply measured the\ndistance between the targeted insertion site and the sternal\nnotch [7]. The insertion length was optimal in approximately\nhalf of the cases and was acceptable (optimal and subopti-\nmal combined) in 81.5% of the inserted cases. Although\nthere is one report on the landmark-based determination of\nthe length of PICC in children with preliminarily taken CXRs\n[16], we did not employ this technique because of the ab-\nsence of images that cover the right arm and the chest alto-\ngether in our institute.\n\nWhile PICC insertion helps patients in postoperative man-\nagement in many ways, it does not change or help in anes-\nthetic management during surgery. From the anesthesiolo-\ngists' perspective, the advantage of PICC is the relatively\nhigh safety compared to other central venous catheteriza-\ntion methods.\n\nOur study had some limitations. First, as we only included\nelective surgeries for MMD and patients were relatively\nhealthy except for that, our cases had a relatively short in-\ndwelling duration of PICC and a low complication rate.\nThese may be valuable data, but the findings are not gener-\n\nalizable to patients with worse general conditions or those\nrequiring extended indwelling. Further studies including\nother populations are needed to obtain more generalized\ndata. Second, as patient satisfaction was not adequately re-\ncorded and compared to that for conventional central ve-\nnous catheterization, we cannot claim that PICC is more pa-\ntient-friendly than conventional insertions. However, since\nthe median duration of indwelling was approximately 7\ndays, it is credible that the insertion site of the forearm will\nbe much more comfortable to maintain than the neck or\nchest. A prospective study comparing PICC and other meth-\nods of central venous access will provide an answer to this\nconcern. Third, the elapsed time ofinsertion was not record-\ned, even though there were some cases with multiple at-\ntempts. Further prospective studies are required to include\nthe time measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, PICC can be successfully introduced to pe-\ndiatric patients undergoing surgery for MMD during anes-\nthetic management without serious complications. Further\nprospective studies including insertion depth determina-\ntion, insertion technique, and comparison with other forms\nof central venous access will be needed to improve our clini-\ncal practice for pediatric patients who require central venous\naccess.
