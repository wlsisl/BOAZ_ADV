Hemifacial microsomia is a congenital craniofacial defor-\nmity, caused by hypoplasia of the first and second branchial\narches. It affects the lower half of the face, most commonly\nthe ear, mouth, and mandible; although a unilateral manifes-\ntation is more common, it can manifest on both sides of the\nface [1]. Difficulty in airway management can be expected,\ndepending on the degree of mandibular hypoplasia, and in-\ntubation can be attempted using a fiberoptic bronchoscope\n(FOB), lightwand, or video laryngoscope [2]. FOB-guided\nintubation is the most versatile and commonly used method\nfor difficult airway management. Moreover, successful FOB\nintubation, using a commercially available guide wire (Arndt�\nAirway Exchange catheter with J-tip guide wire, Cook Critical\n\nCare, USA) has been reported earlier [3-8]. However, most\nof these cases were intubated through the laryngeal mask\nairway (LMA) or face mask, while wire-guided FOB nasotra-\ncheal intubation has been rarely reported. Furthermore, this\nkit is unavailable due to the lack of permission for its import.\nHerein, we report a successful wire-guided fiberoptic naso-\ntracheal intubation in an 18-year-old patient with hemifacial\nmicrosomia who underwent double-jaw surgery.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nAn 18-year-old man (175 cm, 81 kg) with right hemifacial\nmicrosomia was scheduled for double-jaw surgery, correc-tion with distraction osteogenesis, and mandibular anglec-\ntomy. Although he had no underlying medical history, he had\nundergone correction with distraction osteogenesis in 2006.\nAt that time, the patient was classified as Cormack-Lehane\ngrade 4, and oral intubation was performed with FOB. The\npatient reported a history of sleep apnea and heavy snoring,\nduring the preoperative interview. His mouth opening was\nabout 2.5-finger-breadth and neck extension was normal,\nduring the preoperative physical examination. However, he\nhad severe retrognathia and a class III Mallampati score. The\nthyromental distance was less than 6 cm. Moreover, an oral\npanoramic view X-ray showed narrowing of the nasopharyn-\ngeal airway, due to severe retrognathia (Fig. 1. Narrowing of the nasopharyngeal airway seen on the oral pan-\noramic view X-ray (double-headed arrow)). According to\nEl-Anwar et al. [9], the mean depth (anteroposterior diam-\neter) of the nasopharynx in normal adults is 21.8 土 4.6 mm.\nHowever, the depth of nasopharynx in our patient was 15.5\nmm, which was narrower than usual. We explained the pos-\nsibility of a difficult airway and informed the patient about\nthe special risks and procedures pertaining to performing an\nawake intubation procedure. Other preoperative laboratory\nexaminations, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography revealed\nno abnormalities.\n\nOn the day of surgery, we prepared a Glidescope�; LMA,\nfiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus Optical, Japan); a\n0.035-inch-thick, 145-cm-long straight-tipped Angio Guide-\nwire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care, Fig. 2. Angio Guidewire and airway exchange catheter set A: straight-\ntipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care), B: ex-\nchange catheter (CAEC, Cook Critical Care), C: bronchoscope airway\nadapter, D: Rapi-Fit� adapter.\n\n74\n\nwww.anesth-pain-med.org\n\nWire-guided fiberoptic intubation); and a\nhigh-flow nasal cannula (OptiflowTM). Nasotracheal intuba-\n\n.\n\ntion was required to secure space in the oral cavity for sur-\ngery; thus, we prepared nasotracheal tubes of various sizes.\nNon-invasive blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram,\npulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) measurement\nwere performed in the operating room. The monitor showed\nan initial blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, a heart rate of 58\nbeats/min and room air saturation of 98%. Lidocaine 4% was\nsprayed onto the tongue and oropharynx for topical anesthe-\nsia. Sufficient preoxygenation was provided with OptiflowTM, ,\nat a flow rate of 20 L/min, to achieve an SpO2 of 100%. We\nstarted total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with 2% propo-\nfol and remifentanil administered at effect-site concentra-\ntions of 2.5 �g/ml and 1.5 ng/ml, respectively, with a target-\ncontrolled infusion pump. The SpO2 decreased to 96%, soon\nafter the BIS was 42 and the patient fell asleep, but there was\nno further desaturation, after we raised the flow rate of Op-\ntiflowTM to 40 L/min. Since the left nostril was larger than the\nright nostril, owing to right-sided hemifacial microsomia, we\ndecided to insert the FOB into the left nostril. After guiding\nthe FOB into the left nostril of the patient, it passed into the\ntrachea through the glottis, without any issue. We inserted the\n145-cm-long, straight-tipped Angio Guidewire (Lunderquist-\nring, Cook Critical Care) into the working channel ofthe FOB,\ntill we could visualize the entrance of the guidewire into the\ncarina (Fig. 3. The fiberoptic bronchoscope showing that the guidewire is posi-\ntioned in the trachea A: left main bronchus, B: right main bronchus, C:\ncarina, Empty arrow: guide wire.). We carefully removed the FOB and the guide-\nwire remained in position. We also used the Glidescope Ⓡ\nto confirm that the guidewire was still within the oral cavity\n\n\n\nand had passed through the vocal cord, and into the trachea\n(Fig. 4. The guidewire passing through the vocal cord and into the tra-\nchea as seen with the Glidescope� A: epiglottis, B: arytenoid cartilage,\nEmpty arrow: guide wire.). The exchange catheter (1.6-mm internal diameter\n[ID], 2.7-mm outer diameter, CAEC, Cook Critical Care) was\ninserted over the Angio Guidewire and the Angio Guidewire\nwas pulled out. A nasotracheal tube with 6.5 mm ID was ad-\nvanced carefully over the exchange catheter into the airway\nwithout incidence. After removing the exchange catheter,\nthe tracheal tube cuff was inflated, and proper positioning\nof the ETT was confirmed by auscultating both lungs and by\nconfirming continuous positive end-tidal CO2. The moni-\ntor showed a blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg, heart rate of\n95 beats/min, an SpO2 of 97%, and a BIS of 50 after intuba-\ntion. An oxygenation level of 97% or higher was maintained\nthroughout the procedure. After confirming proper intuba-\ntion, we adjusted the effect-site concentration of propofol\nand remifentanil to 4.0 �g/ml and 2.5 �g/ml, respectively,\nand administered 80 mg of rocuronium intravenously. The\ntime required for the administration of intubation to its con-\nfirmation was 16 min. The intra and postoperative periods\nwere uneventful.\n\nAfter the procedure, we provided a full explanation regard-\ning this case report to the patient and obtained permission\nfor the same.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe management of patients with difficult airways is a\n\nconstant source of dilemma for anesthesiologists and special\ncare and attention are essential during the preparation phase\nof anesthesia for these patients. Patients with an anticipated\ndifficult airway for intubation should be interviewed before\nsurgery for any previous history of airway difficulty and a\ndetailed physical examination should be conducted. More-\nover, a variety of equipment for difficult airway management\nshould be prepared, including a video laryngoscope, light-\nwand, supraglottic airway devices, and flexible FOB intuba-\ntion equipment. Awake intubation using FOB should be con-\nsidered, because it is a common method for difficult airway\nmanagement, and was successful in 88-100% of patients with\ndifficult airways, according to earlier studies [10].\n\nHowever, the ETT must be preloaded onto the broncho-\nscope, while performing fiberoptic nasal intubation, which\ncan cause several problems. There is a limit to the size of the\nETT, which can be used because the ETT must be pre-loaded\nonto the FOB. For example, the ETT size available for FOB\nwith a suction port should have an ID of 5.5 mm or more.\nMoreover, resistance may be felt, while advancing the ETT,\ndespite sufficient lubrication; difficulty in deciding the ap-\npropriate size ofthe ETT, due to unexpected turbinate hyper-\ntrophy or deviated nasal septum; and difficulty in passing the\nETT through the vocal cords over the bronchoscope, because\nofinterference by the glottis structures [11,12]. The preloaded\nETT and FOB should be removed in such cases and replaced\nwith a smaller ETT and the procedure should be repeated.\nThis can result in nasal mucosal bleeding, edema, and trau-\nmatic laryngeal injury, which can make visualization through\nthe FOB and subsequent attempts with ETTs of other sizes more challenging [12]. However, wire-guided fiberoptic naso-\ntracheal intubation may possibly overcome the above-men-\ntioned drawbacks, by allowing more time to safely secure the\ndifficult airway. Naithani and Jain [12] reported a case where\nthe guidewire was used as the rescue technique, after the first\nattempt at bronchoscopic nasotracheal intubation failed.\n\nGenerally, a guidewire is included in a commercially avail-\nable airway-exchange set or retrograde intubation set for use\nin difficult airway management [4,8]. A separate Arndt� Air-\nway Exchange catheter with a J-tip guidewire (Cook Critical\nCare) is available in the USA, which includes a 14.0 Fr/70 cm\ncatheter and a 160-cm long guidewire. This set is intended for\nintubation with the LMA conduit using a FOB, bronchoscop-\nic port, J-tip guidewire, and exchange catheter. According\nto Heier et al. [3], once the guidewire and exchange catheter\nare positioned in the trachea, a tracheal tube of 5.0-mm or\ngreater ID can be inserted. Ifa tracheal tube with a smaller ID\nis desired, intubation can be performed by threading the ETT\nover the guidewire alone [3]. However, because the Arndt�\nAirway Exchange catheter with J-tip guide wire has not yet\nbeen introduced in Korea, itmay not be easy to use routinely\nin the same manner as previouslyreported cases.\n\nIn our case, narrowing of the upper airway and difficul-\nties with tracheal intubation were expected owing to severe\nretrognathia in the patient with hemifacial microsomia. Pre-\noperative evaluation should be performed with imaging tests\nsuch as computed tomography (CT), for patients who are ex-\npected to have difficult airways. It is necessary to prepare an\nendotracheal tube suitable for the patient's airway. However,\nCT was not available to confirm the airway preoperatively in\nthis case. Our team was at fault for proceeding with the sur-\ngery without accurate airway evaluation. After the patient en-\ntered the operating room, we determined which endotrache-\nal tube would pass through the patient's nostrils. We decided\nto try 6.5-mm tube first, considering the height of the patient.\nIf the 6.5-mm tube could not be advanced, we attempted to\nreplace it with a smaller tube (through the guidewire). Hence,\nwe prepared to perform wire-guided fiberoptic nasal intuba-\ntion for the patient using a 145-cm long straight-tipped Angio\nGuidewire (Lunderquist-ring, Cook Critical Care). Although\nthis guidewire is not generally used for airway exchange, it is\nmade from polytetrafluoroethylene-coated stainless steel, the\nsame as the Amplatz guidewire (which is a J-tip guidewire),\nincluded in Arndt� Airway Exchange catheter set (Cook Criti-\n\ncal Care). Its diameter is also similar to that of the Amplatz\nguidewire (0.038 inch). Therefore, it could easily pass through\nthe working channel of the FOB in this case. Moreover, the\nlength of the guidewire was adequate for nasotracheal intu-\nbation and the 6.5-mm ID nasal ETT was successfully passed\nalong the guidewire in the first attempt. Ifthe tip of guidewire\nreaches the carina via FOB, additional confirmation of posi-\ntion is unnecessary. Since the Glidescope was prepared in\nadvance for difficult airway management in this case, it was\nused to verify the guidewire's position (Fig. 4). The patient\nwas sufficiently sedated via TIVA and the mouth opening was\n2.5 finger-breadth, and thus, there was no issue with Glides-\ncope blade insertion.\n\nMoreover, TIVA and OptiflowTM can simplify the awake\nFOB intubation procedure. We administered TIVA during the\nprocedure, and the patient was not conscious nor anxious,\nas BIS was maintained within the range of 40-50. OptiflowTM\nensured that the patient's oxygenation was maintained above\n97%, even though he ventilated spontaneously and was se-\ndated deeply. OptiflowTM can supply 50-70 L of oxygen per\nminute and humidified warm air prevents damage to the\nnasal mucosa due to high flow. Moreover, the OptiflowTM\nnasal cannula is soft and occupies less than half of the area of\nthe nostrils, allowing for continuous oxygenation and simul-\ntaneous passage of the fiberscope and tracheal tube. Recent\nstudies have reported that providing sufficient oxygenation\nusing OptiflowTM, helps to prevent oxygen desaturation dur-\ning awake FOB intubation [13,14].\n\nIn conclusion, a difficult airway is one of the biggest chal-\nlenges faced by an anesthesiologist in the operating room.\nIt is necessary to prepare solutions when a difficult airway is\nanticipated, or the conventional intubation technique fails.\nMoreover, knowledge of the different ways of securing a dif-\nficult airway is beneficial, as one method may not be suitable\nfor all situations, depending on the patient's condition. A\nguidewire may be useful, in case of difficultly in advancing\nthe ETT or if a smaller tube is required, while performing\nintubation with FOB in patients with difficult airways. More-\nover, if a commercially available airway-exchange set is not\navailable, other types of guidewire can be used as an alterna-\ntive, as demonstrated by our case.
