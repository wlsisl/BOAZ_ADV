INRTODUCTION\n\nPediatric patients are vulnerable to critical incidents asso-\nciated with anesthesia [1]; moreover, their perioperative care\n\nis challenging and requires a specialized pediatric anesthe-\nsia care team [2]. Reporting and analysis of perioperative\ncritical incidents allow identification of the cause of critical\nincidents, understanding of the current situation, and the development of a prevention strategy [3]. To improve the\nquality of perioperative care and patient safety, it is import-\nant to determine the characteristics of critical incidents and\ntheir temporal changes.\n\nThere have been several reports regarding critical inci-\ndents and cardiac arrests during the perioperative period in\nthe pediatric population [4-9]. We previously analyzed criti-\ncal incidents related to pediatric anesthesia, that occurred\nbetween 2008 and 2013 at a teaching children's hospital [5].\nThe rate of critical incidents was 0.5%; in addition, > 50% of\nall critical incidents were preventable [5]. There have been\nensuing changes in our medical field, including in anesthe-\nsia practice and manpower. For example, point-of-care ul-\ntrasonography has been introduced and widely adapted.\nDevices for difficult airway management, including a high\nflow nasal cannula, supraglottic airway device, and videola-\nryngoscope, have been increasingly employed in routine an-\nesthesia practice. Furthermore, surgical procedures have\nbecome less invasive.\n\nSince 2017, the number of pediatric anesthesia specialists\nof our institute has gradually increased. In particular, it in-\ncreased from an average of 4.8 to 6.2 persons between 2008-\n2013 and 2014-2019. The average cumulative career years\nper junior staff were 1.3 and 4.25 years in 2013 and 2019, re-\nspectively. In addition, there was a gradual increase in anes-\nthesia cases in the outside operating room.\n\nWe speculated that changes in the above factors over time\nmay have contributed to the decreased occurrence of critical\nevents [8]. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the charac-\nteristics of critical incidents, including cardiac arrest, record-\ned between 2014 and 2019, and compare them with those\nrecorded between 2008 and 2013.\n\n# MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n# Study design, center, and population\n\nThis retrospective observational study was performed at\nthe tertiary teaching children's hospital, and the study pro-\ntocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our\nhospital (no. 2005-161-112), which waived the requirement\nfor written informed consent. This study was performed ac-\ncording to the ethical standards set by the 1964 Declaration\nofHelsinki and its later amendments.\n\nData from patients aged ≤ 18 years at the time of surgery,\nbetween January 2014 and December 2019 were included in\nthe analysis. The number of operating rooms and the \"call\n\nfor help\" system were unchanged. If monitoring medical\npersonnel encountered problems, they could call for the\nbackup anesthesiologists using a speakerphone in the oper-\nating room; these encountered problems and critical inci-\ndents were recorded using our own reporting form (Fig. 1A).\nThe patient monitors in each operating room were installed\nin the central monitoring room (Fig. 1B); therefore, from\n2012, vital signs could be conveniently checked in the cen-\ntral monitoring room.\n\nDefinitions\n\nData were collected using a critical incident reporting\nform and electrical medical charts. A critical incident was\ndefined as (i) any incident that altered the patients' vital\nsigns and affected patient management under the anesthe-\nsiologist's care, and (ii) patient injury or accidents that af-\nfected patient safety due to human error. However, simple\nvital sign changes, such as transient desturation which was\nspontaenously recovered or caused by motion artifact, were\nexcluded. The critical incidents were categorized in more\ndetail according to the patient safety policy ofthe Joint Com-\nmission International (JCI), including near miss, no-harm,\nadverse, and sentinel events (Fig. 2). A near miss is an event\nthat could have resulted in harm to a patient, but did not af-\nfect the patient. A no-harm event is an event, that affects the\npatient but does not result in harm, and an adverse event is\nan event that is harmful to the patient; itis defined as an un-\nintended injury to a patient as a result of hospital care and\nnot by the course of disease [10]. A sentinel event is an ad-\nverse event that affects patients resulting in harm such as\ndeath, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm resulting\nin additional invasive intervention. Based on the change in\ndefinitions, the previous data were reclassified as per the\nnew definitions and compared with those from 2014-2019.\n\nCardiac arrest was defined as any event requiring chest\ncompression for maintaining cardiac output, with these\nevents being separately analyzed. For cases of cardiac arrest,\nthe type of problem was classified according to the pediatric\nadvanced life support guidelines. Human factor-related crit-\nical incidents included those that could have been prevent-\ned with more caution, knowledge, advanced techniques,\nand early detection.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nThree anesthesiologists reviewed the electronic medical charts for all reported critical incident cases. Each reported\ncritical incident cases was from voluntary reporting system.\nSubsequently, the critical incidents were classified into five\nmajor classifications (respiratory, cardiovascular, pharma-\ncological, equipment, and others) based on the causes. All\nevents were classified by two anesthesiologists and addition-\n\nally evaluated by another. Disagreements regarding catego-\nrization were resolved through consultation with two other\npediatric anesthesiologists [5]. When multiple events OC-\ncurred simultaneously in one patient, each event was count-\ned as one case. The primary outcome of this study was to\nevaluate changes in the patterns of critical incidents by com-\n\n388\n\nwww.anesth-pain-med.org\n\nCritical events in pediatric anesthesia\n\nparing the incidence of critical incidents on the present and\nprevious data [5] and the secondary outcome was to assess\nquality improvement ofperioperative management by com-\nparing the incidence of cardiac arrest, and human related\ncritical incidents on the present and previous data. Addi-\ntionally, the sample size for analysis was determined by set-\nting the period after the period of the previous study. The\nchi-square test was used for subgroup comparisons between\nthe two selected time intervals (2008-2013 and 2014-2019),\nand mean differences of proportions with 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) were calculated. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed using MedCalc (ver. 12.7.7, MedCalc, Belgium). P <\n0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBetween January 2014 and December 2019, 53,541 cases\nof pediatric anesthesia (3,471 cardiothoracic surgeries) were\nrecorded. We identified 295 critical incidents which repre-\nsented the incidence of 0.55 % (295/53,541). This value was Fig. 2. The categorization of critical incidents: near miss, no-harm\nevent, adverse event, and sentinel event.\n\nsimilar to the 0.46% reported between 2008 and 2013 (mean\ndifference, 0.09%; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.14%; P = 0.287). The in-\ncidence of detailed categorized critical incidents differed be-\ntween 2008-2013 and 2014-2019.\n\nAmong the critical incidents, the incidences of each event\naccording to patient safety policy in 2014-2019 and in 2008-\n2013 are as follow; adverse events 93.9% vs. 98.3% (mean dif-\nference, 4.4%; 95% CI, 0.8 to 8.0%; P = 0.023), sentinel event\n1.7% vs. 2.6% (mean difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, -1.86 to 4.1%;\nP = 0.686), near miss case 0% vs. 1.7% (mean difference,\n1.7%; 95% CI, - 0.06 to 4.4%; P = 0.08) and no-harm events\n6.1% vs. 0% (mean difference, 6.1%; 95% CI, 3.2 to 9.5%; P <\n0.001) respectively (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nThe incidence of critical events was higher among infants\n< 1-year-old (103/10,847, 0.95%) than among children aged\nabove 1-year (192/42,694, 0.45%). The incidence of critical\nevents was higher in patients with American Society of An-\nesthesiologists classification of 3 and 4 (61/4,215, 1.45%)\nthan in those with American Society of Anesthesiologists\nclassifications of 1 and 2 (232/49,306, 0.47%; Table 1.

Table 2 and Fig. 3A present the\ncharacteristics of all the critical incidents that occurred be-\ntween 2014 and 2019. Total critical incidents were not signifi-cantly changed in 2014-2019 compared with in 2008-2013,\nbut critical incidents by classification was different in respira-\ntory events and cardiovascular event between 2008-2013 and\n2014-2019. Respiratory events were the most common criti-\n\ncal events (172/295, 58.3%) during the perioperative period,\nsimilar to that during 2008-2013 (55.4%; mean difference,\n2.9%; 95% CI, -5.9 to 11.7%; P = 0.565). They occurred in the\nfollowing order: tracheal tube related complications (65/172,37.8%), laryngospasm (54/172, 31.4%), and ventilator failure\n(31/172, 18.0%). The proportion of laryngospasm within re-\nspiratory event was increased from 17.3% in 2008-2013\n(mean difference, 14.1%; 95% CI, 3.8 to 23.8%; P = 0.008).\n\nCardiovascular events were the second most common\n(42/295, 14.2%); their incidence was lower than that of the\nprevious data (60/229, 26.2%). The majority of cardiovascular\nevents in 2014-2019 and 2008-2013 were arrhythmias (13/42,\n31%) and hemorrhage or hypotension (22/60, 36.7%), respec-\ntively.\n\nSimilar to a previous report, the third most common cause\nof critical incidents was pharmacological problems. Medica-\ntion error was the most common pharmacological event\n(20/24, 83.3%) and its incidence was higher than that ob-\n\nserved between 2008 and 2013 (8/16, 50%; mean difference,\n33.3%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 61.3%; P = 0.050).\n\nThe proportion of equipment problems was comparable\nbetween 2014-2019 (24/295, 8.1%) and 2008-2013 (14/229,\n6.1%; mean difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, -2.9 to 6.6%, P =\n0.480). Circuit disconnection was the most common in both\n2014-2019 (22/24, 91.7%) and 2008-2013 (10/14, 71.4%).\nCritical incidents categorized as \"others\" significantly in-\ncreased from 5.2% (12/229) in 2008-2013 to 11.2% (33/295)\nin 2014-2019 (mean difference, 6.0%; 95% CI, 1.0 to 10.9%; P\n= 0.020), and they were diverse.

Among them, cardiac arrests caused by human fac-\ntor-related respiratory events appeared to decrease from\n19% (8/42) in 2008-2013 to 4% (1/25) in 2014-2019, although\nwithout significant differences (mean difference, -15%; 95%\nCI, -29.6 to 3.0%; P = 0.080).

\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study updated the data regarding critical incidents\nassociated with pediatric anesthesia at a single tertiary\nteaching children's hospital in 2014-2019, and compared it with previous data obtained in 2008-2013 [5]. Despite the\nincrease in manpower and improvement in monitoring sys-\ntems, the incidence rate and patterns of total critical inci-\ndents did not change significantly over 6 years.\n\nWe hypothesized that the rate of total and human-related\ncritical incidents would be lower than that in 2008-2013 [5],\ngiven the increase in the number of pediatric anesthesia\nspecialists and their experience. According to the multi-\ncenter APRICOT (Anaesthesia Practice In Children Observa-\ntional Trial) study conducted in Europe, the anesthesiolo-\ngist's experience reduces the incidence of severe respiratory\n\nand cardiovascular critical events [8], and may affect the pa-\ntients' outcome [11]. However, we found that the rate oftotal\ncritical incidents did not change considerably. Actually, the\nrate of critical incidents changed differently for each event\n(increased rate of critical incidents such as laryngospasm,\ncircuit disconnection, IV disconnection, and medication er-\nror, whereas, a decreased rate of critical incidents such as\ncardiovascular events). In addition, the proportion of cardi-\nac surgery in human factor related critical incidents de-\ncreased compared to the previous data. For pediatric pa-\ntients undergoing cardiac surgery, interdisciplinary co-work is important in terms of clinical outcome and patient safety\ncompared to noncardiac surgery [12]. Our pediatric cardiac\nanesthesiologists' team member has not changed since 2008\nand the experience has accumulated. In addition, multidis-\nciplinary team collaboration among cardiac anesthesiolo-\ngists, surgeons, pediatricians and nurses have been well es-\ntablished. These factors may contribute the decreased inci-\ndence ofhuman error in cardiac surgery.\n\nThe possible reasons for minimal changes in the critical\nincidents rate are as follows: An increase in the number and\nexperience of specialists could decrease the incidence of\nmore serious events such as cardiovascular events including\ncardiac arrest. On the other hand, this factor would also al-\nlow for faster and more sensitive detection of critical inci-\ndents. The threshold for calling for help and reporting the\ncase could have been lower in 2014-2019 than in 2008-2013.\nBased on the new categorization, the total incidence of near\nmiss and no-harm events increased from 1.8% in 2008-2013\nto 6.1% in 2014-2019, meaning that the detection rate in-\ncreased and early management was done to avoid these\nevents from progressing to adverse events.\n\nAnother reason may be that quality improvement efforts\nmight have been insufficient during the study period, con-\nsidering that medication error and communication error\ncan be significantly improved by quality improvement ef-\nforts. Medication error was an important human error in pe-\ndiatric anesthesia and drug overdose and miscalculation\nwas the most common error [13]. The Wake Up Safe for\nQuality Improvement Initiative in pediatric anesthesia re-\nported that medication error was the third most common\ncritical incident, with 97% of these errors being preventable\n[14]. The communication failures are also preventable and\naccount for a significant number of errors in the operating\ntheater [15].\n\nEven though the incidence of overall critical events did\nnot reduce, there was a significant decrease in the incidence\nof cardiac arrest. This suggests that severe complications\nmay be prevented through early detection of critical inci-\ndents, as well as prompt and appropriate treatment on their\noccurrence. In particular, there was a decrease in respiratory\nevents induced-cardiac arrest, compared to those in 2008-\n2013. The proportion of cardiac arrests with a respiratory\ncause was 23.8% (10/42) in 2008-2013; this declined to 12%\n(3/25) in 2014-2019. We speculated that inclusion of regular\neducation on pediatric difficult airway algorithms in the res-\nident training program after 2013, could have contributed to\n\nthe reduced incidence of respiratory arrests in the operating\nroom. Additionally, there has been an increase in the acces-\nsibility and use of supraglottic airway devices, videolaryngo-\nscopes, and high flow nasal cannula. It can be presumed\nthat appropriate use of these resources has contributed to\nthe reduction in the number of cases of cardiac arrest in-\nduced by respiratory causes.\n\nAfter reviewing our data, we found some points that can\nimprove the quality of pediatric anesthetic care. First, we\nneed to reduce preventable human errors such as medica-\ntion error to decrease critical incidents; many strategies have\nbeen reported to improve these errors [14,16,17]. Second,\neducation program should be further strengthened, espe-\ncially at the beginning of each training year. Bringing atten-\ntion to frequently occurring accidents as well as recognizing\nof complications will reduce the chances of the same events\noccurring again [18]. Third, it is also important to maintain\nconstant resources and interest in what is well maintained in\nterms of quality management. Lastly, it is essential to create\nan environment that encourages voluntary reporting and\ngives constructive feedback to maintain quality control.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, this was a sin-\ngle-center study and may not represent the circumstances of\nall hospitals. Even though we applied the patient safety poli-\ncy of the JCI to complement this limitation of the single cen-\nter study, itis not enough to know the real situation depend-\ning on hospital's situation or prevent critical incident of oth-\ner hospital. Therefore, it is necessary to create a nation-wide\nregistry related to critical incidents in perioperative care.\nSecond, since the study objective was the comparison of\ndata between 2014-2019 and 2008-2013, data regarding\ngender, anesthetic management protocols, anesthetic agents\nused, anesthesia duration, and events related to regional an-\nesthesia were not analyzed as before. Finally, thresholds for\ncalling for help and reporting the cases may have varied de-\npending on the attending anesthesiologists; furthermore,\nthere could have been under-reporting, especially in cases\nofnear miss or no-harm events.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that the incidence of\npediatric perioperative critical incidents did not change sig-\nnificantly over 6 years. However, the incidence of adverse\nevents and cardiac arrests from critical incidents decreased.\nThe majority of critical incidents were associated with hu-\nman error. The implementation of strategies for reducing\nvarious errors should therefore be continued to maximize\nchildren's safety during the perioperative period.\n\n394\n\nwww.anesth-pain-med.org\n\nCritical events in pediatric anesthesia
