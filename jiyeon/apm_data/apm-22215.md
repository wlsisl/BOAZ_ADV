INTRODUCTION\n\nSelection and insertion of an endotracheal tube (ETT) of\nappropriate size for airway management during general an-\nesthesia in pediatric patients is an essential, albeit challeng-\ning task. The outer diameter of the ETT is very important to\ncontrol leakage and protect from aspiration, while the lu-\nmen of the ETT is important for ventilation pressure. The\nuse of the inner diameter to estimate the optimal ETT size\nhas been established clinically. Although traditional age- or\nheight-based formulas have been used to determine the\n\nETT size [1], the initial size selected may not be appropriate,\nand replacement may be required. If a very small ETT is in-\nserted, there is a risk of inadequate ventilation and de-\ncreased reliability of end tidal carbon dioxide monitoring.\nThere is also a risk of air leakage, anesthetic gas leakage, as-\npiration, and high airway resistance [2-5]. Similarly, a very\nlarge ETT may cause serious complications including air-\nway damage, such as ulceration, local ischemia, scar forma-\ntion, post-intubation croup, and, in severe cases, subglottic\nstenosis [6,7]. Therefore, this review article aims to discuss\nthe advantages and disadvantages of conventional and nov-el methods that are used to select an appropriate ETT size\nin pediatric patients.\n\n# PEDIATRIC AIRWAY ANATOMY\n\nThe larynx is mainly funnel-shaped during infancy, with\nthe narrowest part being the nondistensible cricoid carti-\nlage. According to Eckenhoff [8], the larynx is located be-\ntween the pharynx and trachea, and extends from the base\nof the tongue to the cricoid cartilage. It consists of the thy-\nroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, paired arytenoids, epiglottis,\nand corniculate and cuneiform cartilages located around\nthe epiglottis. These pieces of cartilage are connected with\nligaments and affect laryngeal muscle movement. Among\nthem, the cricoid cartilage is located below the largest thy-\nroid cartilage at the C4 level at birth, before settling at the C5\nlevel by 6 years of age [9]. Owing to the small size of the cri-\ncoid cartilage in children, mucosal edema may cause severe\nairway obstruction, and prolonged endotracheal intubation\nincreases the risk of subglottic stenosis [10]. The epiglottis is\nwide and runs parallel to the trachea in adults, but is nar-\nrower, softer, and relatively horizontal in children [11].\n\nRecently, in vivo investigations and review articles have ex-\namined whether the larynx is funnel-shaped in children.\nHolzki et al. [12] reported that when the aryepiglottic, vestibu-\nlar, and vocal folds, which constitute the structure of the la-\nryngeal upper airway, are maximally abducted, they have a\nlarger openingin the glottis than the outlet ofthe cricoid ring.\n\nMoreover, although the pediatric larynx is conical, the\n\nnarrowest part, the rima glottidis, is cylindrical in the antero-\nposterior dimension regardless of development, and the cri-\ncoid ring is slightly elliptical [13,14]. However, based on the\nactive contraction ofthe laryngeal muscles, Litman et al. [15]\nsuggested that the narrowest part of the larynx is the trans-\nverse dimension at the level of the vocal cords, while the cri-\ncoid ring is functionally the narrowest part.\n\nUNCUFFED VS. CUFFED ETTS\n\nUncuffed ETTs and cuffed ETTs have advantages and dis-\nadvantages (Table 1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Uncuffed and Cuffed Endotracheal Tubes [13]\n\n| Characteristics | Uncuffed endotracheal tubes | Cuffed endotracheal tubes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Advantages Disadvantages | · Larger internal diameter for age - Less resistance to airflow - Lower breathing load - Reduced blockage by secretions - Easy suctioning · Minimal mucosal pressure - Prevents trauma to sub-glottic region · Several attempts of laryngoscopies and intubations · Airway injury - Oversized tubes, excessive pressure on cricoid mucosa - Undersized tubes, movement trauma · Leakage of air - Incorrect respiratory monitoring - Increased risk of aspiration - Environmental pollution | · Smaller external diameter for age - Less pressure on cricoid mucosa · Improved ventilation and respiratory monitoring · Fewer attempts of laryngoscopies and intubations · Reduced risk of aspiration · Reduced air pollution · Smaller internal diameter for age - Higher resistance to airflow - Increased blockage by secretions - Difficult suctioning · Airway injury - Tracheal rupture - Mucosal ischemia) [13]. Traditionally, uncuffed ETTs have\nbeen used in children below 8 years old, because the cricoid\ncartilage is the narrowest part in this age range [16]. Litman\netal. [15] and Dalal et al. [17] found that, as the cricoid carti-\nlage is nearly ellipse-shaped, circular uncuffed ETTs may\ncause leakage in the empty anterior and posterior spaces,\nthus possibly putting excessive pressure to the sides [14].\nTherefore, cuffed ETTs can reduce the number of endotra-\ncheal intubation attempts, and if cuff pressure can be main-\ntained within a safe range, the risk of airway damage may\nnot exceed that of an uncuffed ETT [18-20]. In addition, the\nuse of cuffed ETTs reduces the risk ofleakage during positive\npressure ventilation, ensuring patient safety through ade-\nquate ventilation and lack of aspiration, and reduces con-\ntamination of the surrounding air by inhaled anesthetics\n(Fig. 1. Endotracheal tube (ETT) with cross-sectional circular shape in an elliptical-shaped airway (A) and in a circular airway (B). When\nplaced in an elliptical airway, there may be lateral pressure on the mucosa of the trachea, and possible leakage during continuous positive\nairway pressure test above and below the ETT in the anterior-posterior diameter. When a cuff (violet) is inflated in the elliptical airway, the\nairway can be sealed with equal pressure on all aspects of the tracheal wall (C).\n\n![image](/image/placeholder)\nVocal cords\nCricoid ring\nCarina\nCarina-to-tip distance) [21-23]. Therefore, the use of cuffed ETTs in children\nis increasing. However, excessive pressure in the cuff can in-\nhibit perfusion to the tracheal mucosa and cause postopera-tive sore throat, subglottic edema, or stenosis [24-26]. Pedi-\natric ETT cuffs must be very thin to meet the high-volume\nlow-pressure standards, and the cuff must be short enough,\nso that its upper boundary is stably positioned in the sub-\nglottic region below the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 2. Ideal position of the cuffed endotracheal tube.) [14]. In ad-\ndition, although the tip of the ETT should have a sufficient\nsafety margin over the tracheal bifurcation, selection of an\nappropriate ETT is challenging, because the outer diameter,\nsize, and location of the cuff vary between manufacturers.\nThe cuff may not meet the criteria for high volume and low\npressure, and the depth may not be marked [27].\n\nMicrocuff ETTs are a new type of ETTs, which are of poly-\nurethane. The cuff is located more distally on the ETT shaft,\nand there is no Murphy's eye (Black mark\nShort, ultra-thin distally placed\npolyurethane cuff\nMurphy's eye absent\n\nFig. 3. Microcuff endotracheal tube.). Therefore, the cuff may\nbe positioned below the non-distensible cricoid ring, where\na 20 cmH2O inflation pressure maintains a cross-sectional\narea of approximately 150% of the maximal internal tracheal\ncross-sectional area. In the deflated state, the outer diameter\nofthe microcuff ETT is minimally increased; therefore, it can\nbe safely used in children [28,29]. However, this type of cuff has not been introduced in Korea yet. With the development\nof newer polyvinyl chloride high-volume low-pressure\ncuffed ETTs in the late 1990s and ultrathin polyurethane mi-\ncrocuff ETTs in the early 2000s, the use of cuffed ETTs has\nincreased in infants and children weighing ≥ 3 kg. While\nmost studies on cuffed ETTs in infants only included infants\n≥ 3 kg [20,21,30-34], Thomas et al. [33] reported that micro-\ncuff ETTs can be safely used in neonates weighing < 3 kg.\n\nHOW TO SELECT AN APPROPRIATE\nETT SIZE\n\nConventional methods\n\nThe age-based formula suggested by Cole has long been\nused to select the appropriate ETT size in children [35].\nWhen an uncuffed ETT is used based on the Cole formula,\nit has a larger internal diameter (ID); therefore, airway re-\nsistance, and edema formation caused due to mucosal\ndamage by cuff pressure can be reduced [1]. In children >\n2 years old, the Cole formula [ID (mm) = (age/4) + 4.0]\ncan be used to determine the appropriate uncuffed ETT However, a recent study suggested that the pediatric air-\nway shape is elliptical, rather than round [28], leading to a\ntransition from uncuffed to cuffed ETT use in children. In\naddition, although the ID is standard for each manufacturer,\nselection of an appropriate cuffed ETT size is difficult, be-\ncause the outer diameter varies [29,36]. Accordingly, Khine\net al. [31] suggested a new formula [ID (mm) = (age/4) + 3.0]\nfor the increased outer diameter of a cuffed ETT because of\nthe inflatable cuff. However, Duracher et al. [37] recom-\nmended a novel formula [ID (mm) = (age/4) + 3.5] to select\nthe appropriate cuffed ETT size, because Khine's formula\nwas found to underestimate the ETT size by 0.5 mm. Recent-\nly, Manimalethu et al. [38] compared these three formulas\nand found that Duracher's formula best determined the ap-\npropriate size when a cuffed ETT was used. However, appli-\ncation of this formula in infants weighing less than 3 kg and\nchildren under 2 years old is difficult. Khine et al. [31], Mo-\ntoyama [16] and Salgo et al. [39] suggested the use of cuffed\nETT sizes according to age (Table 2).\n\nNewly induced method\n\nBecause age-based formulas in children are not always\naccurate, ETTs with an inner diameter with a 0.5 mm devia-\ntion from the calculated size for endotracheal intubation\nshould be prepared [1,40]. In cases of an inappropriate ETT\nsize, unnecessary endotracheal intubation may be attempt-\ned several times. Various methods for estimating ETT size,\nother than the age-based formula, have been examined and\nsuggested.\n\n1. Chest radiography\n\nPark et al. [41] conducted a study using uncuffed ETTs in\n537 pediatric patients between 3 and 6 years old and recom-\n\nTable 2. Recommendations for Age-based Cuffed Endotracheal\nTube Size Selection (mm)\n\n| Age (yr) | Khine et al. [31] | Motoyama et al. [16] | Salgo et al. [39] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Birth to < 0.5 | 3.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 |\n| 0.5 to < 1.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 | 3.5 |\n| 1.0to < 1.5 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.5 |\n| 1.5to < 2.0 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 4.0 |\n| 2.0to < 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n| 3.0to < 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n| 4.0to < 5.0 | 4.0 | 4.5 | 4.5 |\n\n\nmended a radiograph-based formula [ID (mm) = 3 + 0.3 X\n(tracheal diameter at seventh cervical vertebra)] through\nlinear regression modeling. The authors measured the tra-\ncheal diameter at the seventh cervical vertebra based on\nchest radiography (Fig. 4. ID (mm) = 3 + 0.3 x (tracheal diameter at at C7 from chest\nradiograph. C7: seventh cervical vertebra, ID: internal diameter.) and substituted it into the radio-\ngraph-based formula. The success rate was higher than that\nofthe standard age-based formula [ID (mm) = (age/4) + 4.0]\n\n2. Ultrasound\n\nUltrasound is a reliable, noninvasive, point-of-care test\nthat can be used to evaluate the airway diameter. Recently,\nseveral studies have investigated the use of ultrasound in\nETT size selection in children (Table 3. Studies that Examine the Appropriate Pediatric ETT with Ultrasound Measurements\n\n| Study | Cohort | Initial tube size selection | Tube type | Condition | Allowed leak pressure | Measurement level |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Shibasaki et al., 2010 [45] | n = 192 1 mo-6 yr | Age- and height- based formulas | Cuffed and un- cuffed | Apnea with no CPAP | 10-20 cmH20 for uncuffed ETT 20-30 cmH20 for cuffed ETT | At the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage |\n| Bae et al., 2011 [43] | n = 141 < 8 yr | Age-based formulas | Uncuffed | 10 cmH20 CPAP | 15-30 cmH20 | At the mid cricoid cartilage level |\n| Schramm et al., 2012 [44] | n = 50 < 5 yr | Age-based formulas | Uncuffed | Apnea with no CPAP | 15.3-25.5 cmH20 | At the narrowest portion of the subglottic airway (MTDSA) |\n| Kim et al., 2013 [42] | n = 215 1-72 mo | Age-based recommendation | Cuffed | Apnea | No air leakage test | At the mid cricoid cartilage level |\n| Raphael et al., 2016 [46] | n = 60 2-15 yr | Age-based formulas | Uncuffed | Apnea | 10-20 cmH20 | At the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage |\n\n\nETT: endotracheal tube, CPAP: continuous positive airway pressure, MTDSA: minimal transverse diameter of the subglottic airway.) [42-46]. Altun et al.\n[47] reported that the subglottic diameter of the airway,\nmeasured with ultrasound ( Fig. 5. Ultrasonographic measurement of the transverse subglottic\ndiameter of the cricoid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage appears as a\nround hypoechoic structure with hyperechoic edges, composed of\nperichondrium. The transverse subglottic diameter is determined\nby measuring the dimension of the air-mucosa interface (between\nthe two white crosses) within the bilateral inner margin of the\ncricoid cartilage.) to determine the appro-\npriate size of cuffed ETT for children, can be a reliable pa-\nrameter. In addition, the use of ultrasound for airway evalu-\nation in children can provide information about subglottic\nairway narrowing and vocal cord movement and help to\npredict a difficult airway [48].\n\nHowever, because the ultrasound-measured airway diam-\neter represents the outer diameter of the ETT, it must be\nconverted to the corresponding inner diameter. Therefore,\nthe ETT size may vary owing to the different outer diameters\nused between manufacturers. Reportedly, the subglottic an-\nteroposterior diameter in children is slightly larger than the transverse diameter [15,28], the assessment of anteroposte-\nrior diameter is limited due to air shadows, and the mea-\nsurement of transverse diameter at this level may underesti-\nmate the actual tracheal diameter [42].\n\n3. Three-dimensional (3D) airway model\n\nPark et al. [49] found that prediction of the correct ETT\nsize using a 3D-printed airway model demonstrated better\nresults than the age-based formula in pediatric patients with\ncongenital heart disease. This shows that selection of ETT\nsize using a 3D-printed airway model may be feasible to re-\nduce the number of reintubation attempts and complica-\ntions. However, image quality can be affected by patient res-\n\npiration during computed tomography (CT) scans, and it is\ndifficult to apply 3D conversion software programs to air-\nway images, compared to solid organs, because of the air\nlayer. In addition, image conversion is required through\nthe use of several programs and CT (Fig. 6. (A, left) An FDM type 3D printer CreatBot (CreatBot F430, Henan Suwei Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., China) was used to print\n3D airway models from the sub-glottis to the upper carina.

This formula is suitable for uncuffed\nETTs; however, recent changes in the understanding of pe-\ndiatric airway anatomy, redefined the use of cuffed ETTs.\nCuffed ETTs can reduce the number of endotracheal intu-\nbation attempts, and if cuff pressure can be maintained\nwithin a safe range, the risk of airway damage may not in-\ncrease, compared to an endotracheal tube without a cuff.\nWhen estimating cuffed ETT size using an age-based for-\nmula, Duracher's formula [ID (mm) = (age/4) + 3.5] is\nmore accurate. However, a tube 0.5 mm larger or smaller\nthan the calculated size should always be possible to use.\nBecause age-based formulas in children are not always ac-\ncurate, various methods for estimating ETT size, such as\nchest radiography, ultrasound, and three-dimensional air-\nway models, have been investigated. However, these meth-\nods have several limitations, and further studies are war-ranted to ensure proper use in clinical situations.\n\nPusan National University Yangsan Hospital.
