Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare autosomal recessive dis-\norder, characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, episodic hyper-\nventilation, abnormal eye movement, and psychomotor\nretardation [1]. Some of these clinical features of JS corre-\nspond to those of patients with mitochondrial disease\n(MD). MD manifests symptoms based on the ratio of nor-\nmal mitochondrial DNA to mutated mitochondrial DNA\n[2]. Mitochondria are an important survival-related com-\nponent, and the range of diseases that can be manifested\nby dysfunction in mitochondrial metabolic pathways is\nvery wide. Anesthesia management for patients with these\n\ncongenital disorders and coping with unexpected compli-\ncations during surgery is a challenge for anesthesiologists.\nIt is important to thoroughly identify the patient's condi-\ntion and carefully select and prepare the best anesthesia\nmethod. Here, we present the anesthetic care of a patient\nwho had been diagnosed with JS and MD.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained for publication\nof this report.A 13-year-old male patient was scheduled for elective in-\nsertion of a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\n(CAPD) catheter. The admission height and weight were\n135 cm and 31 kg, respectively. The patient was born at 40\nweeks by normal vaginal delivery and was admitted to the\nneonatal intensive care unit for 10 days because of sepsis.\nMD was diagnosed at 12 months of age and then JS was di-\nagnosed during outpatient observation. The patient started\nhemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease at the age of 8\nyears and was hospitalized at age 10 years with intracranial\nhemorrhage due to high blood pressure. The patient was\nadmitted at age 11 years for uncontrolled hypertension and\na change in the permanent catheter, but hyperkalemia-in-\nduced cardiac arrest occurred. The patient returned to\nspontaneous circulation after 1 h of cardiopulmonary re-\nsuscitation (CPR) and was transferred to the intensive care\nunit (ICU) to receive post-CPR care for 2 weeks. Subse-\nquently, the patient was hospitalized and discharged re-\npeatedly due to heart, lung, and kidney problems. He un-\nderwent regular hemodialysis; however, hemoglobin level\nand blood pressure continued to fall and could not be con-\ntrolled. Therefore, the patient was scheduled to switch to\nperitoneal dialysis.\n\nIn terms of mental status, the patient was stuporous\nduring pre-anesthetic assessment (Glasgow coma scale\n[GCS] score 11). He was bed-ridden, with a percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy tube that was inserted in the sur-\ngical ICU (SICU). Hypotension was managed by infusion of\nnorepinephrine (0.07-0.19 �g/kg/min). His mean blood\npressure (MBP) and his heart rate (HR) were controlled at\n90-106 mmHg and 95-107 beats/min, respectively, and\nchecked every 30 min. His breathing was shallow; however,\n100% oxygen saturation was maintained on room air. We\nreviewed all of the records, including previous hospital\ncharts, but the patient had never undergone surgery, and\nwe found no accurate information about his airway. The\npatient's jaw was small, his mouth was slightly protruding,\nand he had a short neck with reduced cervical mobility.\nHis airway could not be evaluated properly due to the poor\nopening of his mouth because of the rigidity of his jaw;\nthus, we decided to perform a reassessment at the time of\nanesthesia induction on the day of surgery. Three anesthe-\nsiologists decided to participate in induction because this\nwas a rare case that we had not previously experienced in\nour hospital. We decided to have the following instruments\nin place for airway management: oral airway (size 1 and 2),\nstylets, a Macintosh direct laryngoscope (curved blade siz-\n\nes 2 and 3), a video-laryngoscope (McGrath, Aircraft Medi-\ncal, UK and C-MAC, Karl Storz, Germany), a fiberoptic\nbronchoscope (Olympus Optical, Japan), and a supraglot-\ntic airway device (SAD; I-gel, Intersurgical Ltd., UK). We se-\nlected an endotracheal tube (ETT) according to age based\non height and weight and prepared 5.0- and 5.5-mm tubes\nwith cuffs.\n\nBlood sugar before leaving for the operating room was\n132 mg/dl. In the operating room, routine standard moni-\ntors were attached (noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP],\nelectrocardiography, pulse oximetry); the initial NIBP and\nHR were 120/90 mmHg and 105 beats/min, respectively,\nwith a norepinephrine infusion of0.07 �g/kg/min. Invasive\nblood pressure monitoring was not performed and the sur-\ngery time was expected to be short; thus, the operation\nproceeded after preparing for left radial artery cannulation,\nif necessary. The degree of neuromuscular blockade, as-\nsessed using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation, was moni-\ntored using an IntelliVue NMT monitor (Philips, the Neth-\nerlands), and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring (Covidien,\nUSA) was performed to assess the depth of anesthesia. The\ninitial BIS was 71. Anesthesia was started with propofol (1\nmg/kg), remifentanil (0.05 �g/kg/min), and rocuronium\n(0.4 mg/kg) following preoxygenation. Intravenous propo-\nfol and remifentanil infusions were started at 77-102 �g/\nkg/min and 0.05-0.1 �g/kg/min, respectively, to maintain\nanesthesia (BIS 40-60). The patient's jaw was small; how-\never, his palate was not malformed, his tongue did not pro-\ntrude, and mask ventilation was well maintained. A third-\nyear anesthesiology resident tried to insert an I-gel of size\n2.5, which was selected according to the patient's weight.\nThe resident began to insert the I-gel along the hard palate\nwith one hand pressing down on the patient's chin. Resis-\ntance was felt while inserting the I-gel, thus he gently\npushed the I-gel using the deep rotation method and con-\nnected the I-gel to the ventilator. However, air continued to\nleak, and a sufficient tidal volume was not attained. The at-\ntending anesthesiologist determined that the I-gel did not\nfit properly, and removed and inserted it again using the\njaw thrust method with the help of another attending anes-\nthesiologist. Nevertheless, air continued to leak, and the\nI-gel was removed, as it had become malpositioned. The\ntrachea was secured with a 5.0-mm ETT without difficulty\nusing a McGrath (blade size 2) by the attending anesthesi-\nologist, and the Cormack-Lehane grade was 1. A pilot bal-\nloon was inflated with room air to a cuff pressure of 18 cm-\nH2O as measured by a manometer (VBM, Germany). Lung sounds had decreased on the left side and coarse breath\nsounds were auscultated over both lower lung fields. The\nETT was fixed at 15 cm from the lower incisor teeth. Me-\nchanical ventilation was performed with a 50:50 air/oxygen\nmixture, a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of\n16-18 breaths/min, a maximum peak airway pressure of\n11-14 cmH2O, and an inspiratory/expiratory time ratio of\n1:2. End-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation were\nmaintained at 35-39 mmHg and 100% during the surgery,\nrespectively. The operation lasted 45 min, and the patient's\nhemodynamics were stable during the procedure. The\nMBP and HR were controlled at 73-103 mmHg and 105-\n130 beats/min, respectively, with a norepinephrine (0.03-\n0.07 �g/kg/min) infusion. The TOF count was maintained\nat 1-2 during surgery, and there was no additional injec-\ntion of muscle relaxants. No additional opioids were used\nother than remifentanil. At the end of the operation, the\npatient's spontaneous breathing returned and the BIS and\nTOF ratio were 73 and 76%, respectively; however, the res-\npiration rate was < 10 times/min. The pediatrician wanted\nto observe the patient's breathing pattern more carefully;\nthus, after injecting 3 mg midazolam, the patient was trans-\nferred to the SICU with the ETT. In the SICU, the patient's\nmental state was stuporous (GCS score 6), and a ventilator\nwas applied with the following settings: synchronized in-\ntermittent mandatory ventilation mode with a FiO2 of 0.25,\ntidal volume of 6 ml/kg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min,\nand pressure support of 13 cmH2O. The MBP and HR were\nmaintained at 105-111 mmHg and 124-137 beats/min, re-\nspectively, with a norepinephrine (0.07 �g/kg/min) infu-\nsion. The trachea was extubated at 1 hour after the patient\narrived in the ICU, and no irregular respiratory patterns\nwere observed. The patient exhibited 100% oxygen satura-\ntion with a 2-L oxygen flow applied by nasal cannula. Ac-\ncording to the venous blood gas analysis, the venous pH\nwas 7.30, PCO2 53 mmHg, PO2 47 mmHg, base excess 0.3\nmmol/L, SO2 78%, glucose 130 mg/L, and lactate 0.3\nmmol/L.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nJS is a genetic disorder caused by a malformed cerebella\nvermis. The typical manifestations of JS are hypotonia,\nataxia, episodic apnea-hyperpnea, and global develop-\nmental delay [1]. JS patients also characteristically have a\nlarge tongue, a cleft or highly arched palate, and microg-\nnathia [3]. This disease can also present as a variety of clin-\n\nical features depending on the organs that have been af-\nfected; thus, JS increases the risks associated with anesthe-\nsia management [1]. Above all, the difficulty with patients\nwith JS is to secure and control the airway due to an abnor-\nmal breathing pattern and the differences in facial shape\nand oral structure [1]. Patients with JS are susceptible to al-\nmost any anesthetic, making it difficult to titrate an appro-\npriate dose of the anesthetic agent while maintaining an\nintact airway for simple procedures.\n\nThe focus of the anesthesiologist, in this case, was respi-\nratory management. Inserting a CAPD catheter is a simple\nprocedure that is generally controlled during monitored\nanesthesia care in our hospital. However, management of\nthe airway was expected to be difficultin this case and gen-\neral anesthesia was planned. In this case, unfortunately, it\nwas not helpful to review previous hospital records of\nwhether there were issues with the patient's airway. It is\nimportant to thoroughly assess any patient feature suggest-\ning a difficult airway [4]. We focused primarily on observ-\ning the patient's appearance and the passive movement of\nthe neck due to the poor mouth opening and the inability\nto respond to commands during the pre-anesthetic evalua-\ntion. In addition, indicators, such as upper incisor length,\nthyromental distance, length of the neck, and neck circum-\nference of the patient would have been helpful for the air-\nway evaluation [4].\n\nMirghassemi et al. [5] suggested that it is difficult to mea-\nsure these indicators in pediatric patients; thus, they pro-\nposed a method for predicting difficult airways based on\nmeasuring and calculating the distances from the lower lip\nboard to the tip of the chin, from the ear tragus to the cor-\nner of the mouth, and from the ear lobe to the corner of the\nmouth. While it is important to prepare advanced airway\nequipment when a difficult airway is expected, itis also im-\nportant to have additional anesthesiologists available to\nassist during emergency situations [4]. We had one anes-\nthesiology resident and two attending anesthesiologists,\nand each had prepared the advanced airway equipment\nmost familiar to them. As the number of attempts at tra-\ncheal intubation increases in patients with a difficult air-\nway, the probability of complications also increases. Thus,\nfor pediatric patients with a difficult airway scheduled a\nsimple procedure that is expected to finish in a short time,\nas in this case, the use of a SAD may be advantageous [6].\nThe I-gel is an anatomically shaped SAD that seals the air-\nway without a cuff; thus, it is easy to insert and remains\nstable. The patient, in this case, had a small jaw, but no other major problems were found with the oral structure,\nso mask ventilation was carried out smoothly; hence, we\ndecided to insert the I-gel. However, the I-gel did not fit\nproperly in two attempts, and eventually, the patient was\nintubated. Because an I-gel is inserted without direct visu-\nalization of the airway, malpositioning is possible, which\nleads to an incomplete seal, resulting in leakage or obstruc-\ntion of the airway, eventually leading to problems with\nventilation. The anesthesiologist can adjust the depth of\nthe I-gel or choose a different size [7]. Although there was a\nmajor leak, in this case, the size of the I-gel was considered\nappropriate for the patient, so we did not attempt to re-in-\nsert a different size. As an alternative, the I-gel was inserted\nwith the jaw thrust method; however, the leak continued,\nso the anesthesiologist decided to intubate the airway. In\naddition, post-extubation respiratory problems can occur\nafter positive pressure ventilation during general anesthe-\nsia for surgery. It has been recommended that such pa-\ntients be transferred to the ICU without extubation for con-\ntrolled ventilation [8]. The patient in this case also devel-\noped spontaneous respiration after the surgery; however,\nthe breathing pattern was very weak and slow. The patient\nwas transferred to the ICU while intubated and was extu-\nbated after confirming that sufficient tidal volume had\nbeen reached.\n\nMD is categorized into various types of mitochondrial\ngenetic mutations and is expressed in a wide range of clini-\ncal forms. MD patients usually have myopathies and vari-\nous clinical manifestations in the central nervous system,\nheart, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys [9]. These patients\nmay be vulnerable to situations that can increase metabol-\nic burden, such as prolonged fasting, hypovolemia, and hy-\npothermia, which require attention during the periopera-\ntive period [9]. In general, almost all anesthetic agents sup-\npress mitochondrial function, particularly the inhalation\nanesthetics and propofol [9]. In addition, propofol inhibits\nmitochondrial metabolism in at least four steps, which is\nrelated to propofol infusion syndrome. For this reason,\nprolonged continuous infusion of propofol in patients with\nMD should be avoided [8]. Patients with mitochondrial\nmyopathy are likely to develop respiratory failure, so care\nshould be taken when using neuromuscular blocking\nagents and opioids [9]. Nevertheless, MD patients usually\ntolerate various anesthetics without major problems [10].\nThese patients may also have increased susceptibility to\nmalignant hyperthermia [2]; however, this is controversial.\nFootitt et al. [11] reviewed 58 anesthesia records in pediat-\n\nric patients with MD and found no adverse events, such as\nmalignant hyperthermia or rhabdomyolysis. The Malig-\nnant Hyperthermia Association of the United States stated\nthat the susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia does not\nincrease in MD patients; however, they concluded that the\nselection of an appropriate anesthetic is important de-\npending on the patient's symptoms and type of surgery and\nthat more attention should be paid to the use of succinyl-\ncholine [12]. The patient in this case was expected to have\na short operation of less than 30 min, so we used propofol\nand remifentanil, which are relatively easy to titrate with a\nrapid post-anesthesia recovery [9]. However, a report on\nMD patients showed delayed recovery after a short propo-\nfol infusion and the need for ICU care [13]. The use of less\nthan 200 mg of propofol might have affected the recovery\nfrom anesthesia of the patient in our case.\n\nPatients who have been diagnosed with both mitochon-\ndrial dysfunction and JS, such as our patient, have been re-\nported, but they are very rare [14]. These diseases are char-\nacterized by different ranges of symptoms depending on\nthe organs that are affected. However, symptoms in the\nmusculoskeletal, respiratory, and neurological systems can\nbe similar in both\n\ndiseases and are important considerations during anes-\nthesia management [1,10]. Several studies have shown that\nJS and MD patients can tolerate most of the commonly use\nanesthetics [15].\n\nIn summary, it may be difficult to manage anesthesia in\npediatric patients with more than one congenital condi-\ntion, and the characteristics of each abnormality will need\nto be well understood. In this case, we focused more on\nMD when selecting the anesthetics and focused on JS for\nairway management. In addition, the difficulty and expect-\ned time of the scheduled surgery were also considered.\nThere is generally no clear anesthesia indication for pa-\ntients with several congenital diseases. It would be ideal for\nthe anesthesiologist to properly apply the carefully chosen\nanesthesia technique under surveillance monitoring, and\npreparation for an emergency is also important.
