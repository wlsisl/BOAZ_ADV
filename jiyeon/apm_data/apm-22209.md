INTRODUCTION\n\nAirway management is a challenging task in children and\na variety of devices have been developed precisely for this\npurpose. A safer alternative to endotracheal intubation was\nbrought to the fore by Archie Brain, namely a supraglottic\n\nPediatric-size SGAs are limited, and these devices have\nbeen innovated and modified from their adult counterparts, although their efficacy and safety in this subset of the popu-\nlation are limited [3]. A network meta-analysis on the use\nand evaluation of different SGAs in pediatric patients con-\ncluded that I-gelTM (Intersurgical Ltd., UK) is one of the most\nstudied SGAs in children with a high oropharyngeal leak\npressure (OPLP) and the lowest risk ofblood staining among\n16 SGAs studied [4]. Another second-generation laryngeal\nmask airway (LMA) is BlockbusterTM LMA (Touren Medical\nInstrument Co., Ltd., China), invented in 2012 by Professor\nMing Tian, made of silicone with an inflatable cuff [5]. Till\nnow no study was available in literature that compared effi-\ncacy and safety of these devices in pediatric population.\n\nTherefore, we designed this study to compare the clinical\nperformance of BlockbusterTM LMA with that of I-gelTM in\npediatric patients with the hypothesis that LMA-Blockbuster\nwould have comparable efficacy to I-gel when used in pedi-\natric patients.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis study was conducted in tertiary care centre after ap-\nproval from Institutional Ethics Committee (no. SNMC/\nIEC/2020/Plan/313) and registration in the Clinical Trial\nRegistry ofIndia (no. CTRI/2020/09/028079). Informed writ-\nten consent was taken from the parents of all patients. Chil-\ndren of age 1-5 years, weighing between 5 and 25 kg, belong-\ning to the American Society of Anesthesiologists- physical\nstatus I or II, scheduled for elective surgery under general\nanesthesia were included in this study. The syndromic ba-\nbies, upper respiratory tract infections, silicone allergy,\nemergency surgery, abnormal anatomy of pharynx and lar-\nynx, those at increased risk of aspiration and patients who\nhave received oxygen support or mechanical ventilation in\nthe past one month were excluded from the study.\n\nChildren were randomized to either group- the I-gelTM\ngroup (Group I) or the BlockbusterTM LMA group (Group B)\nusing a computer-generated random number table. To en-\nsure the confidentiality ofthe assignment, random numbers\nwere placed in a sealed opaque envelope which was opened\nupon the child's arrival in the operating room.\n\nPatients were kept nil per oral as per standard fasting\nguidelines. Monitoring consisted of electrocardiography,\nnon-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and pulse oximetry,\nand baseline vital parameters were recorded. Children were\npremedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg intravenously\n(IV), and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 �g/kg and\nand propofol 2-3 mg/kg IV. Intravenous atracurium 0.5 mg/\n\nkg was administered after confirmation of satisfactory mask\nventilation. The airway was secured with one of the airway\ndevices as per group allocation. The airway device size was\nchosen according to body weight and manufacturer recom-\nmendations. The lubricated device was inserted in a neutral\nhead position. Both these devices were inserted along the\nhard palate with the airway device shafts held approximately\nparallel to the patient's chest until resistance was felt. The\nBlockbusterTM LMA cuff was inflated with the appropriate\namount of air according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nThe ventilator was attached to the device and effective\nplacement was assessed by bilateral equal chestmovements,\nsquare wave capnograph, absence of gastric insufflations\nepigastrium auscultation and delivery of adequate tidal vol-\nume. The insertion time was calculated as the time from\npicking up the device to the appearance of the first capno-\ngraphic waveform on the monitor. The number of insertion\nattempts was also calculated. Insertion failure was marked if\nthe airway could not be secured in three attempts and the\npatient was intubated via directlaryngoscopy with an appro-\npriate size endotracheal tube. The primary outcome of the\nstudy was the comparison of the OPLP and secondary out-\ncomes were insertion parameters such as ease of insertion,\ntime of insertion and number of attempts, as well as hemo-\ndynamic changes and incidence of postoperative complica-\ntions.\n\nThe OPLP was determined one minute after securing the\nairway by closing the circle system's expiratory valve at a\nfixed gas flow of3 L/min. The airway pressure at which equi-\nlibrium was reached and a gas leak occurs as determined by\nan audible leak or by detection of an audible noise with a\nstethoscope placed directly lateral to the thyroid cartilage\nwas the OPLP [6].\n\nEase of insertion was assessed by an objective rating de-\npending on the number of airway manipulations required to\nintroduce the LMA with no manipulation, only one manipu-\nlation and more than one manoeuver rated as very easy,\neasy and difficult respectively. Hemodynamic parameters\nincluding heart rate, NIBP and peripheral oxygen saturation\n(SpO2) were recorded at baseline, immediately after device\ninsertion and every 5 min until surgery was completed. An-\nesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in an O2-air mix-\nture with a targeted FiO2 of 40%. Anesthetics were discontin-\nued at the end of the operation; 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine was\nadministered together with 0.01 mg/kg glycopyrrolate to re-\nverse the effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent. Upon\nreturn of adequate spontaneous breathing and muscle strength, the device was removed as soon as the child was\nawake. The device was examined for blood stains and the\nchild was evaluated for other postoperative complications.\n\nAll patients' SGAs were inserted by anesthesiologists, who\nhad at least 3 years of SGAs insertion experience or had at\nleast 50 SGAs insertions before the start of the study. The\nOPLP, SGA insertion time, hemodynamic parameters, and\npostoperative complications were noted and recorded by\nan independent observer who was unaware of the inserted\ndevice.\n\nThe sample size was calculated on previous study by Kim\net al. [7] The oropharyngeal leak pressure for I-gelTM was\nmean 土 SD; 27.1 土 6.1 cmH2O. Assuming a minimum differ-\nence of 3 cmH2O to be clinically significant, the minimum\nsample size calculated to be 66 in each group at type I error\nof 0.05 and power of80%. To account for potential dropouts,\nwe enrolled 70 patients in each group.\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the\ndistribution of all continuous variables. An independent\nt-test was used for the normally distributed variables. Fish-\n\ner's exact test and chi-square test were used for comparison\nof qualitative data. The continuous variables were described\nin mean 土 SD, while categorical variables were described in\nnumbers and percentages. Differences were considered sig-\nnificant at P < 0.05.\n\nA total of 149 patients were evaluated for eligibility, of\nwhich 5 patients were excluded due to symptoms of upper\nrespiratory tract infection on the day of surgery and the par-\nents of 4 children refused to participate, so the remaining\n140 patients were included in the final analysis. Selected\nchildren were randomly assigned to Group I and Group B\n(Enrollment\nAssessed for eligibility (n = 149)\nExcluded (n = 9)\n· Upper respiratory tract infection (n = 5)\n· Declined to participate (n = 4)\nRandomized (n = 140)\nAllocation\nAllocated to l-gel group (n = 70) Allocated to Blockbuster group (n = 70)\n· Received allocated intervention (n = 70) · Received allocated intervention (n = 70)\n· Did not receive allocated intervention (n = 0) · Did not receive allocated intervention (n = 0)\nFollow-up\nLost to follow-up in group I (n = 0) Lost to follow-up in group B (n = 0)\nDiscontinued intervention (n = 0) Discontinued intervention (n = 0)\nAnalysis\nAnalysed from the I-gel group (n = 70) Analysed from the Blockbuster group (n = 70)\nExcluded from analysis (n = 0) Excluded from analysis (n = 0)\n\nFig. 1.

Both groups were found to be compara-\nble in terms of ease of SGA insertion. The devices were suc-\ncessfully inserted on the first attempt in 97.14% and 90% of\nthe I-gelTM group and BlockbusterTM LMA groups respective-\nly (Table 2.

All hemodynamic parameters and cases ofpost-\noperative complications were comparable between both\ngroups.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe main results of the study show that both I-gelTM and\nBlockbusterTM LMA provide adequate sealing pressure around\nthe laryngeal inlet. However, the I-gelTM provides a compara-\ntively better airway seal than the BlockbusterTM LMA.\n\nEffective and adequate sealing around the glottis becomes\n\nimportant when SGAs are used during surgery to prevent\nloss of tidal volume, avoidance of operative room air con-\ntamination, repeated airway switching and reduce the risk\nof regurgitation. To ensure adequate ventilation, an ideal\nSGA should have an OPLP higher than ventilation airway\npressure or greater than 20 cmH2O [8]. In the literature pedi-\natric counterparts of various first-generation SGA such as\nclassic LMA, flexible LMA, LMA unique, etc. have reported\nOPLP of 16 to 20 cmH2O [9]. Second-generation devices\nsuch as the LMA Proseal, Air-Q, I-gelTM, and LMA Supreme\nare also available in pediatric sizes and have better seal pres-\nsure compared to first-generation devices [7,9-11].\n\nIn our study, the OPLP ofBlockbusterTM LMA has been re-\nported to be lower than I-gelTM (26.04 土 2.12 mmHg and\n27.97 土 1.65 mmHg respectively), although both these de-\nvices provide adequate seal pressure when used for positive\npressure ventilation. I-gelTM has a non-inflatable thermo-\nplastic polymer cuff that is known to conform itself to the\nglottis to provide an effective seal around the glottis. The cuff\nis said to respond to body temperature to create an adequate\nseal around the glottis to resist leakage during positive pres-\nsure ventilation [11,12]. With the BlockbusterTM LMA, the\n95-degree angled breathing tube and the cuff shape of the\nBlockbusterTM LMA can be responsible for the high sealing\npressure [5]. In most studies, the OPLP of I-gelTM was report-\ned to be greater than 20 cmH2O in pediatric patients [13-15].\nWhile studies using BlockbusterTM LMA in pediatric patients\nare limited. Endigeri et al. [16] reported an OPLP of Block-busterTM LMA of 33.7 土 1.8 cmH2O in adult patients, which\nis higher than observed in our study. Though a higher OPLP\ndoesn't always guarantee an appropriate placement, it is\ncommonly used objective test to guide correct placement. A\nhigher OPLP suggests proper placement of device around\nperilaryngeal structure and ability of the device to sustain\nleak during positive pressure ventilation. Though in our\nstudy a statistically significant difference was observed be-\ntween two devices, with I-gelTM reported to have higher seal\npressure, but clinically this difference was not very signifi-\ncant as if SGA is achieving an OPLP more than 20 cmH2O, it\ncan sustain leak during spontaneous or controlled ventila-\ntion in pediatric patients. There are plenty of studies in\nI-gelTM in pediatric patients and I-gelTM is considered to be a\nprototype second generation LMA but BlockbusterTM LMA is\nnewly introduced with limited studies available on its use in\nchildren. So, our study finding support the use of Blockbust-\nerTM LMA for pediatric airway management, however further\nrandomized controlled trial are required to confirm and\nsupport our study findings. We inflated the BlockbusterTM\nLMA as per manufacturer specification but further study of\ninflation pressures and positioning may help optimize the\nBlockbusterTM LMA.\n\nThere was no case of failed insertion of the LMA in either\ngroup, with airways secured in 97% and 90% of the first at-\ntempts in the I-gelTM and BlockbusterTM LMA groups respec-\ntively. Studies have reported a greater than 95% first-attempt\nsuccess rate for I-gelTM [17]. Ease of insertion was compara-\nble for both I-gelTM and BlockbusterTM LMA with 100% of\nboth groups having \"easy\" and \"very easy\" insertion. Total\ninsertion time was comparable between I-gelTM and Block-\nbusterTM LMA at 15.51 土 1.62 and 15.92 土 3.02 s respectively.\nAll insertions were performed in < 30 s which is acceptable\ngiven the time required to secure an airway. Both I-gelTM and\nthe BlockbusterTM LMA had a sleek and streamlined design\nthat could be deployed quickly, even considering the ana-\ntomical challenges presented by pediatric airways. Previous\nstudies have found that I-gelTM took a longer time to insert\nand this was attributed to I-gelTM straight shape which\nshowed frequent displacements. It has also been shown that\nthe I-gelTM requires consistent downward mechanical pres-\nsure to stay in place with close contact with the glottis. We\nhad no such difficulties in our study and were able to\npromptly fix I-gelTM in place. The BlockbusterTM LMA with its\ninflatable cuff and the angled tube, did not cause any diffi-\nculties worth mentioning during insertion.\n\nAll hemodynamic variables were comparable in both\n\ngroups with no significant change in parameters at different\nintervals in the study. Similarly, the incidence of postopera-\ntive complications was zero in I-gelTM and one incidence of\nblood stains in BlockbusterTM LMA. All insertions were per-\nformed by trained individuals and therefore the optimal\nsafety seen with both SGA devices was to be expected.\n\nLimitations of our study include enrolling subjects with\nnormal airways with no prior anatomical pathology. Second,\nwe did not evaluate the additional features of both LMAs\nsuch as gastric channels and the ability to be used as a chan-\nnel for intubation. Third, we have not confirmed the fiberop-\ntic position of any of the LMA after insertion and we have\nnot evaluated the inflation cuff pressure in the BlockbusterTM\nLMA.\n\nTo conclude, the I-gelTM delivered significantly higher\nOPLP than BlockbusterTM LMA, otherwise, both LMAs are\ncomparable in terms of performance. Both I-gelTM and\nBlockbusterTM LMA are appropriate devices for positive\npressure ventilation in pediatric patients undergoing short\nsurgical procedures under general anesthesia with minimal\npharyngolaryngeal morbidity.
