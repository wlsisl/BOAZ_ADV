INTRODUCTION\n\nItis exceedingly difficult to detect the pain occurring during\nsurgery under general anesthesia accurately and to perform\nappropriate pain control, and the level of analgesia provided\nduring the operation is fundamental, because it is directly\nlinked to postoperative pain and complications. This is es-\npecially important for pediatric patients, because it is more\nchallenging to communicate with them than adults during\nthe perioperative period. Moreover, postoperative emergence\nand recovery patterns of pediatric patients are different from\n\nthose of adults, and it is also difficult to predict the degree of\npostoperative pain (due to a limitation of pain rating scales).\nTherefore, if the degree of nociception (pain) during surgery\nis objectively predicted and evaluated, thereby appropriately\ncontrolled in such pediatric patients, postoperative pain can\nbe effectively reduced, and it may be helpful to perform ad-\nditional analgesia for residual pain and to prevent postopera-\ntive complications.\n\nIn addition, while regional anesthesia (analgesia) can be\nperformed in an arousal state in adults and the evaluation of\nits effectiveness (success or failure) is possible, it is exceed-ingly difficult to perform the procedure in an arousal state in\npediatric patients. In this case, the evaluation of the success\nofregional analgesia becomes more difficult because the pro-\ncedure is performed during general anesthesia. If there is a\nnociception monitoring device that can appropriately evalu-\nate the effect of local anesthetics administered for regional\nanalgesia, by monitoring before and after regional analgesia,\nit is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of regional analge-\nsia and to judge its success. In this respect, intraoperative no-\nciception monitoring can be beneficial for perioperative pain\nmanagement in pediatric patients.\n\nDuring the last two decades, several nociception monitor-\ning tools have been developed, which utilize physiological\nmarkers that are useful for performing objective pain assess-\nments. Of these, the most common method is to measure\nthe degree of pain by measuring changes in the autonomic\nnervous system (ANS) activity [1]. Depending on which ANS\nsurrogate marker-including pulse wave amplitude and\npulse beat interval, heart rate variability, skin sweating, and\npupillary changes-is used by each device, the basic operat-\ning principles and characteristics of the device (surgical pleth\nindex, analgesia nociception index, heart rate variability,\nskin conductance, or pupillometry etc.) are determined. This\narticle reviews the efficacy, reliability, and limitations of the\ndevices for intraoperative analgesia in pediatric patients un-\ndergoing general anesthesia by analyzing the results of the\nstudies on the nociception monitoring devices for pediatric\npatients reported so far-even though the results are fewer\nthan those for adults [2]. A better understanding ofthe nature\nof these devices may help provide more effective and safe\nperioperative analgesia to pediatric patients undergoing sur-\ngeries using general anesthesia.\n\nLITERATURE SEARCH STRATEGIES\nAND RESULTS\n\nA literature search for the review was performed on major\ninternational and South Korean databases (PubMed, Em-\nbase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and KoreaMed) to\nidentify articles including systematic reviews, meta-analyses,\npractice guidelines, narrative reviews and clinical trials pub-\nlished since 1990 that assessed nociception or pain using\nnociception monitoring tools or indices for analgesic guid-\nance in pediatric patients undergoing surgery using anes-\n\nthesia. Databases were searched with the strings made using\nthe Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free text terms\n(Analgesia; Anesthesia, general; Autonomic nervous system;\nChildren; Monitoring, intraoperative; Nociception test; Pain\nmeasurement etc.). After the initial electronic search, the\nauthor evaluated the bibliographies of the identified studies\nand performed a manual search using Google Scholar. The\narticles identified were assessed individually for inclusion in\nthe analysis.\n\nSearches of the databases yielded 1,010 articles (Fig. 1). Of\nthese, 950 publications were excluded, because it was clear\nfrom the title and abstract that they did not fulfill the selec-\ntion criteria. From the remaining 60 articles, 30 potentially\nrelevant studies were identified by scrutinizing the full-text\narticles. Thirty other publications were excluded because\nthey included adult patients, or did not include available in-\nterventions (pain measurement with nociception monitoring\ntools or indices using autonomic tone changes in pediatric\npatients undergoing surgery under anesthesia). Therefore, 30\nstudies were finallyincluded in this review (Fig. 1 \nIdentification\nRecords identified through Additional records identified\ndatabase searching through other sources\n(n = 990) (n = 20)\nRecords after duplicates removed\nScreening (n = 595)\nRecords screened Records excluded\n(n = 595) (n = 535)\nEligibility\nFull-text articles assessed Full-text articles excluded,\nfor eligibility with reasons that they did\n(n = 60) not include eligible\npatients or interventions\nfor this review).\n\n# ANS MARKERS FOR NOCICEPTION\nASSESSMENT\n\nPostoperative pain increases ANS activity (i.e., increases\nsympathetic nervous system activity and postoperative anal-\ngesia suppresses the response) [3-5]. Similarly, nociception\ncaused by surgical stimulation during general anesthesia\ncauses the release of stress hormones, and the level of stress\nhormone release depends on the level of analgesia provided\n[6,7]. This is because there is a neuroanatomic overlap be-\ntween the pain transmission path and the ANS pathway [8];\nthese rationale and findings have led to the assumption that\npain causes a change in ANS activity, which has resulted in\nthe development of several monitoring devices using ANS\nsurrogate markers for objective pain assessment. Derived\ncardiovascular and respiratory parameters including pulse\nwave amplitude, pulse beat interval, heart rate variability, the\npattern of blood pressure, and heart rate responses are rep-\nresentative ANS surrogate markers [1]. In addition, sweating\nand pupillary changes are also used as ANS markers for noci-\nception monitoring [1].\n\nAlthough studies on various nociception monitoring de-\nvices have been conducted on adults, recent research results on pediatric patients have also been reported. It is essential\nto understand the efficacy and limitations of the nociception\nmonitoring tools in pediatric patients undergoing general an-\nesthesia by analyzing existing literature and research results,\nespecially to recognize the differences between the pediatric\nand adult results, in order to appropriately provide intraop-\nerative analgesia based on these monitoring devices. There-\nfore, in addition to the 30 pediatric studies included in this\nstudy, the representative studies performed by applying the\nnociception monitoring tools used in the pediatric studies to\nadults were also cited and compared in this review.\n\nNOCICEPTION MONITORING TOOLS\nUSING PULSE WAVE AMPLITUDE AND\nPULSE BEAT INTERVAL\n\n# Surgical pleth index (SPI)\n\nSPI, also called the Surgical Plethysmographic Index or\nSurgical Stress Index, is a simple, non-invasive monitoring\ntool used to assess nociception during anesthesia by analyz-\ning the waveform and heartbeat of photoplethysmography in\npulse oximeters. SPI is calculated using the pulse photople-\nthysmographic amplitude (PPGA) and heartbeat interval\n\n1. Flow diagram for article search\ninclusion criteria in the review.\n\n(HBI), which are measurable in the photoplethysmography\n[9] as follows in this equation,\n\n$$\\mathrm{SPI}=100-\\left(0.67\\times\\mathrm{PPGA}+0.33\\times\\mathrm{HBI}\\right)$$\n\n(1)\n\nSPI values range from 0 (no stress) to 100 (maximum stress\nlevel), and in previous studies, an SPI range of 20-50 usually\nindicates adequate analgesia during surgery under general\nanesthesia [10-13]. It is also recommended to keep SPI val-\nues below 50 and avoid rapid increases (more than 10-point\nincrease over a short time) as another criterion to maintain\nadequate analgesia [14].\n\nThe effectiveness of SPI as a tool for monitoring and evalu-\nating nociception and administering analgesics in adults was\ndemonstrated in several studies [10-13,15]. Notably, they\nhave shown that SPI-guided analgesia offers several clinical\nbenefits in comparison to analgesia based on conventional\nhemodynamic parameters during surgery under general an-\nesthesia [10,12,13,16,17]. In contrast, limitations have been\nreported for various clinical situations and confounding fac-\ntors [18-23], one of which may be age. Thus, limitations pre-\nsented in the studies ofpediatric patients must be considered\ncarefully [19,24,25].\n\nAlthough the number of studies related to SPI in children is limited, efforts to reduce the incidence of postoperative\npain and complications by appropriately evaluating nocicep-\ntion during surgery and performing appropriate analgesia\nhave been attempted in various forms. The results have\nbeen reported in several ways, also [19,24-26]. Harju et al.\n[26] observed changes in intraoperative SPI in two groups\nreceiving ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric\nnerve block with saline or ropivacaine before the beginning\nof surgery after anesthesia induction in patients under 24\nmonths old undergoing inguinal hernia surgery. As a result,\nan increase in SPI was observed in both groups after endo-\ntracheal intubation, whereas an increase in SPI during surgi-\ncal incision was observed only in the saline-injected group.\nHarju et al. [26] reported that the reactivity of SPI to surgical\nstimuli was blunted in the ropivacaine-injected group, sug-\ngesting that SPI monitoring may be useful for determining\nthe analgesic effect of the nerve block in pediatric patients\nundergoing regional analgesia, but also reported that the\nreactivity of the SPI was rather small, and there was a limita-\ntion of marked inter-individual variability in SPI reactions\nto nociception. More importantly, several other pediatric\nstudies about SPI have shown that children have less confi-\ndence in SPI than adults, and thus children should receive\nintraoperative analgesia based on SPI levels that differ from\nthose of adults. Supporting this, Park et al. [19] found that the\ncardiovascular structure and function of children-especially\nthe vascular distensibility-is different from adults and that\nthe actual nociception levels in children are not reflected in\nSPI values and the pediatric SPI value tends to be lower dur-\ning surgery. A possible explanation is that ultrasonographic\nexaminations of vascular structures showed lower vascular\nwall stress and higher distensibility in children than in ado-\nlescents [27], and basal catecholamine concentrations and\nresting muscle sympathetic nerve activity are also lower in\nchildren than in adults [28]. Due to these characteristics, the\nstimulation of vascular smooth muscle and vascular contrac-\ntile force that occur during the activation of the sympathetic\nnervous system may be less in children. Two factors deter-\nmine SPI values, HBI and PPGA, of which PPGA depends on\nthe vascular wall distensibility and intravascular pulse pres-\nsure [29] and has double the effect on SPI values compared to\nHBI (Equation 1). Because children have lower vascular con-\ntractility and higher vascular distensibility than adults, activa-\ntion of the sympathetic nervous system due to nociception is\n\nunlikely to significantly reduce PPGA as in adults, which can\nresult in underestimation of SPI values.\n\nThe notion that there is less reduction in PPGA in children\nthan in adults due to the unique characteristics of children's\nvascular response at the time of nociception is supported by\ncomparing the SPI data of previous studies. Compared with\nthe results of two studies that reported changes in SPI, heart\nrate (HR), and PPGA during endotracheal intubation after\nadministration of2 �g/kg offentanyl for anesthesia induction\n[30,31], the change in SPI values (the amount of increase) af-\nter endotracheal intubation was relatively higher in the adult\nstudy [30], while the change in HR was similar. Therefore, it\ncan be inferred that the amount of change in PPGA, that is,\nthe amount of decrease in PPGA, would have been higher in\nadults. Indeed, the median difference for PPGA before and\nafter intubation reported in the pediatric study [31] was small\n(-0.51).

Comparison of photoplethysmographic (PPG) responses between adults and children for nociception during anesthesia. The schematic dia-\ngram shows the difference between adults and children on the change of the PPG signal during endotracheal intubation at anesthesia induction.\nThe changes (decrease) of the photoplethysmographic amplitude (PPGA) and area under the curve (AUC) are smaller in children, and the resulting\nchanges (increase) of the surgical pleth index (SPI) values are also smaller in children (refer [SPI OC 1/AUC]). That is, this difference in PPG responses\nfor nociception may cause a difference in SPI values between adults and children. (A) PPG waveforms in adults. With an assumption that heartbeat\ninterval (HBI) equals to PPGA (HBI = PPGA = �) and the data of SPI and heart rate in the reference (Mustola et al. Anesthesiol Res Pract 2010; 2010:\n810721 [30]), the following equations can be established and thus the values of the variables can be assumed: �' = a - 6.2 = 55.8 - 6.2 = 49.6; B\n= a 、 22.8 = 55.8 - 22.8 = 33.0. (B) PPG waveforms in children. With an assumption that HBI equals to PPGA (HBI = PPGA = y) and the data of SPI\nand heart rate in the reference (Kallio et al. Br J Anaesth 2008; 101: 383-9 [31]), the following equations can be established and thus the values\nof the variables can be assumed: Y'= Y - 8.2 = 60.8 - 8.2 = 52.6; 8 =y - 17.5 = 60.8 - 17.5 = 43.3. This figure is newly drawn based on the data of\nthe two studies [30,31] that reported changes in SPI, heart rate, and PPGA during endotracheal intubation.)Fig. 2 schematically shows the data from these two\nstudies and the changes which occur in the photoplethys-\nmography in adults and children at the time of nociception,\nthe difference between them, and how the SPI values are\nchanged.\n\nIn summary, Park et al. [19] reported that for children\nundergoing tonsillectomy under general anesthesia, intra-\noperative fentanyl requirement was lower for the SPI-guided\nanalgesia group than for hemodynamic parameters-based\nanalgesia, but postoperative pain and emergence agitation\nscores and rescue fentanyl dose were higher in the SPI-guid-\ned analgesia group, and thus SPI values in children are less\nlikely to accurately reflect the nociception-antinociception\nbalance due to their unique cardiovascular structure and\nphysiology. It was concluded that re-establishment of the\ntarget SPI range or the development of new formulas for\nchildren is necessary for proper intraoperative analgesia in\nchildren undergoing general anesthesia.\n\nLedowski et al. [24] also found that SPI cut-off values of 50,\nthe most commonly used cut-off value in SPI-related studies,\ndo not have clinically appropriate sensitivity or specificity to\npredict the presence of acute pain in the recovery room, and\nsuggested that it may be more appropriate to adjust to a cut-\noff of 40 or lower (which is lower than the existing cut-off val-\nue of50) to provide intraoperative analgesia that avoids mod-\nerate and severe postoperative pain in children. Ledowski et\nal. [24] reaffirmed that, in children, intraoperative analgesia\nduring general anesthesia should be performed based on SPI values that differ from those in adults.\n\nSong et al. [25] also reported there was no significant dif-\nference in SPI changes during cranial pin fixation among the\ngroups received sufentanil infusion at three different rates\n(0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 �g/kg/h) in pediatric patients aged 2-12\nyears who underwent cranial pinning under general anesthe-\nsia, suggesting that SPI may not be sensitive enough to moni-\ntor a level of nociception and analgesia in children.\n\nA systematic review using meta-analysis of six randomized\ncontrolled trials, examining the efficacy and safety of SPI-\nguided analgesia and conventional analgesia based on he-\nmodynamic parameters (blood pressure and HR) and during\nsurgery under general anesthesia, showed that SPI-based an-\nalgesia reduced intraoperative opioid requirement and short-\nened extubation time, and there was no difference in the de-\ngree of postoperative pain and the incidence of perioperative\ncomplications [32]. Based on these findings, the systematic\n\nreview suggested that nociception monitoring and analgesic\nadministration using SPI are more useful for providing prop-\ner analgesia under general anesthesia in various clinical situ-\nations. However, considering that the number ofrandomized\ncontrolled studies included in this study is few, and only one\nof the included studies is for children [19], and the results of\nother studies related to SPI in children are conflicting [24-26],\nfurther studies are needed to determine the efficacy of SPI for\nintraoperative analgesia, especially in children.\n\nNOCICEPTION MONITORING TOOLS\nUSING HEART RATE VARIABILITY\n\nHeart rate variability (HRV)\n\nHRV refers to the degree of change (variability) in time\nand frequency analysis of the interval between successive heartbeats, which reflects the activity and balance of the au-\ntonomic nervous system, i.e., the interactions between the\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. HRV\nmonitoring devices calculate and measure HRV parameters\nsuch as standard deviations of normal RR intervals on stan-\ndard electrocardiogram (time-domain analysis) or high-fre-\nquency (HF), low-frequency (LF), very low-frequency (VLF)\npower, and LF/HF ratio (frequency domain [power spectral\ndensity] analysis) quickly, easily, and non-invasively [33,34].\nThe LF/HF ratio is a quantitative measure of the overall bal-\nance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystem and, when the ratio is high, indicates an increase in\nsympathetic activity or inhibition ofparasympathetic activity.\n\nHRV can be measured in both conscious patients and\nthose under sedation or anesthesia [35-37], but similar to SPI,\nit can be affected by several physiological or psychological\nconditions such as age (typically decreasing with age) [38],\ndrugs [39], psychological problems [40], comorbidities [41,42],\ndepth of sedation or anesthesia [43,44], and surgical stimuli\n[45]. Several clinical studies examining the correlation be-\ntween the intensity ofnoxious stimuli such as surgical stimuli\nand corresponding HRV in anesthetized adult patients sug-\ngested that HRV could be used as an objective pain assess-\nment tool [46,47]. In contrast, studies for HRV in unanesthe-\ntized adultpatients showed conflicting results [48,49].\n\nIn addition, numerous studies have investigated the rela-\ntionship between established behavioral indicators of pain\nand HRV at the evaluation of acute pain in pediatric patients,\nincluding preterm infants, newborn (neonate) infants, in-\nfants, and children in various clinical settings [50-52]. Con-\nsequently, HRV usually responded well to pain in most pedi-\natric age groups, but the findings in infants were inconsistent\n[53]. On the other hand, physiological indicators (nociception\nmonitoring devices), including HRV, are the only tools that\ncan measure nociception in anesthetized younger children,\nbut the results reported so far have limitations due to the na-\nture of HRV, which is susceptible to several factors [54,55].\n\nTherefore, several real-time algorithms and indices using\nthem have been developed to correct such confounding fac-\ntors of HRV so that changes in HRV correspond well to the in-\ntensity of nociception. These algorithms and indexes include\nanalgesia nociception index, cardiorespiratory coherence,\nand newborn infant parasympathetic evaluation (NIPE).\n\nAnalgesia nociception index (ANI)\n\nANI (MetroDoloris Medical Systems, France) combines\nelectrocardiogram and respiratory rate with high-frequency\nadjustment (0.15-0.4 Hz) in the frequency domain analysis\nof HRV and shows parasympathetic activity in the numeri-\ncal range of 0 (maximal pain) to 100 (no pain) (as opposed to\nSPI). Previous studies on ANI regarded ANI ≥ 50 as appropri-\nate analgesia and predicted that ANS responsiveness was\ncaused by nociceptive stimulation when ANI < 30 [56,57].\n\nThe efficacy of ANI in intraoperative nociception monitor-\ning and analgesia has been well documented through studies\nperformed in adults [56,58,59]. Recent studies in pediatric pa-\ntients also reported that ANI was more sensitive to detecting\nsurgical stimuli during surgery and useful for monitoring in-\ntraoperative analgesia than other hemodynamic parameters\n[60-62].\n\nConsidering that ANI is shown to reflect not only intraop-\nerative pain but also postoperative pain, that is, the degree of\npain in conscious patients, itmay have advantages over other\npain monitoring devices [63,64]. Nevertheless, there are still\nstudies that reported the opposite results [57,65], much like\nthe controversial issue of its reliability in conscious patients\nin the correlation between HRV and pain intensity [48,49].\n\nCardiorespiratory coherence\n\nCardiorespiratory coherence, a non-invasive nociception\nmonitoring device, measures a degree of. ANS activity by ana-\nlyzing the linear combination intensity between heart rate\nand respiration during general anesthesia and assesses the\ndegree of pain in a range from 0 (low coherence, strong no-\nciception) to 1 (high coherence, no nociception). It includes\nreal-time cardiorespiratory coherence; cardiorespiratory\ncoherence algorithm, or wavelet transform cardiorespiratory\ncoherence algorithm. Although there are very few studies\nevaluating the efficacy of cardiorespiratory coherence to date,\nmost of them have been conducted in children, and they\nreported notable outcomes that cardiorespiratory coherence\nis more sensitive and superior to hemodynamic parameters\nin detecting nociception, antinociception, and movement in\npediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia [66-68].# Newborn infant parasympathetic evaluation\n(NIPE)\n\nANI was developed for HRV analysis in children over 2\nyears old and adults. Newborns, infants, and children under\n2 years of age require a modified approach to HRV analysis\nbecause they have a lower HRV due to an immaturity of the\nANS and high basal heart rate. The NIPE index (MetroDo-\nloris Medical Systems), a modified form of ANI nociception\nmonitoring, was developed for use in newborns (including\npremature infants) and children under 2 years of age [69].\nThe basic principle of NIPE is to analyze the parasympathetic\nactivity of the ANS in real-time using HRV analysis. HRV sig-\nnals above 0.15 Hz allow for automated HRV analysis of data\nindicative of parasympathetic nervous system activity via a\nhigh pass filter and exhibiting physiological respiratory sinus\narrhythmia [69]. This automated analysis is quantified by the\nNIPE index, which ranges between 0-100 to reflect relative\nparasympathetic activity, with higher values indicating higher\nlevels of parasympathetic activity. A NIPE index of less than\n50 in newborns and infants under anesthesia usually suggests\na presence of stress or nociception and insufficient analgesia\n[70].\n\nNIPE does an excellent job reflecting a balance of nocicep-\ntion and antinociception. NIPE decreases in the presence\nof nociception in anesthetized infants and newborns, while\nincreases in cases of loss of nociception or administration of\nanalgesics [70,71]. In addition, Valencia-Ramos et al. [72] re-\nported that NIPE monitoring reflected a change in the degree\nof comfort during nebulization for conscious infants with\nbronchitis in the intensive care unit. NIPE was suggested as a\ncomfort monitoring system for infants. NIPE may also reflect\npsychological conditions such as psychological stability or\ndiscomfort and stress in conscious infants and newborns.\nTaken together, even if the evidence is still lacking, NIPE\nmonitoring of nociception and analgesia, or discomfort and\ncomfort in newborns and infants under two years of age un-\nder anesthesia or awareness may be more effective than other\nnociception monitoring modalities. However, Cremillieux\net al. [73] reported that the NIPE index during painful proce-\ndures of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit\ndid not reliably reflect acute pain. Thus, further research is\nrequired to study these issues.\n\n# NOCICEPTION MONITORING TOOLS\nUSING SKIN SWEATING\n\nSkin conductance algesimeter (SCA)\n\nA SCA measures an increase in stress reflected in changes\nin the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. When the\nsympathetic nerves are activated, the plantar sweat glands\nin the palms and soles are filled with sweat. When the sweat\nreaches the skin, the skin resistance decreases, and the skin\nconduction increases, and when the sweat is reabsorbed, the\nskin conduction decreases again. When the skin nerves are\nactivated by stimulation, both amplitude and frequency of\nefferent skin nerve bursts increase. Therefore, the increase\nin the number of skin conductance fluctuations (NSCF) and\namplitude of skin conductance fluctuations in SCA measure-\nments may be interpreted as increased activity of the sympa-\nthetic nervous system [74,75].\n\nUnlike other nociception monitoring tools, the SCA index\nis not affected by circulatory changes, cardiac activity, vaso-\nactive drugs, or neuromuscular blockade. Therefore, SCA\nis more sensitive and specifically associated with pain and\nnoxious stimuli [76]. The SCA index responds quickly (in\nseconds) and allows continuous and objective monitoring\nwith a wide range of indications in various clinical situations.\nIt also has higher sensitivity and specificity in assessing pain\nthan other monitoring devices currently available. SCA has\nbeen extensively studied, particularly in pediatric patients,\nfor its efficacy and is known to be useful in assessing pain and\nanalgesia. For premature infants, SCA is more sensitive and\nspecific than behavioral-state observations in evaluating heel\nstick pain during blood sampling, tactile stimulation stress,\nand high decibel sound stimuli [77-79]. Both in healthy new-\nborns and artificially ventilated infants, an increased NSCF\non SCA monitoring correlated well with occurrences of pain\nand discomfort [80,81].\n\nSeveral studies evaluating the efficacy of SCA concerning\ngeneral anesthesia in adult patients have shown that the SCA\nindex is useful in monitoring perioperative stress with in-\ncreasing values during nociceptive stimulation, such as endo-\ntracheal intubation and tetanic stimulation, and decreasing\nvalues during analgesic infusion [82,83]. Regarding postop-\nerative pain, several studies have reported that the SCA index\nis well correlated with the numeric rating scale assessed by the recovery room [84,85].\n\nFew studies of SCA have been conducted on children un-\nder general anesthesia. Sabourdin et al. [61] reported that the\nresponses of SCA to remifentanil at different infusion rates\nin children under general anesthesia was less sensitive than\nthose of ANI. Therefore, despite many advantages of SCA, the\nevidence is still lacking in its efficacy for analgesia in pediatric\npatients undergoing general anesthesia. Thus further studies\nare required on these topics.\n\n# NOCICEPTION MONITORING TOOLS\nUSING PUPILLARY CHANGE\n\n# Pupillometry\n\nPupillometry is based on the evaluation of the pupillary re-\nflex dilatation induced by nociceptive stimulation. Pupillom-\netry is a non-invasive monitoring technique which measures\ndynamic pupillary diameter by an infrared camera. Pupillary\ndiameter increases in response to nociceptive stimulation.\n\nThe degree of pupillary dilatation in patients with anesthe-\nsia using propofol or inhalational anesthetics is associated\nwith the intensity ofnociceptive stimuli during operation. The\npupillary reflex dilatation by nociception in pediatric patients\nwas maintained during deep sedation with ketamine, and the\ndegree of pupillary dilatation was related to the intensity of\nthe nociceptive stimuli [86]. Therefore, pupillometry can be\na useful nociception monitoring tool in pediatric patients se-\ndated with ketamine. Additionally, it has been suggested that\npupillometry is a useful nociception monitoring device by\nother studies in children and adolescents undergoing general\nanesthesia, which showed that nociceptive stimuli during an-\nesthesia cause pupillary reflex dilatation, and administration\nof opioid analgesics or deep anesthesia (hypnosis) decreases\nthe pupil diameter [87-89]. However, it must be considered\nthat other factors such as severe anxiety [90] or drugs [91,92]\nalso influence the pupil diameter and reflex.\n\nREGIONAL ANALGESIA AND OPIOID\nCONSUMPTION DURING GENERAL\nANESTHESIA\n\nRegional analgesia in pediatrics are performed after the\ninduction of general anesthesia and before skin incision to\n\nreduce the surgical stress response and to spare intravenous\nopioid administration during surgery. The adequacy of re-\ngional analgesia in children has traditionally been assessed\nby monitoring changes in hemodynamic parameters caused\nby noxious stimuli. Inadequate regional analgesia is often\ndefined as an increase in heart rate of about 10-20% or more\nfrom baseline within 1 to 2 minutes after surgical incision\n[93,94]. However, the use of these hemodynamic parameters\nto assess the effects of regional analgesia is not standardized\nand may be inaccurate [95-98]. Therefore, there have been\nattempts to perform a faster and more accurate evaluation\nand to minimize intravenous opioid requirements during\nsurgery by determining the effects ofregional analgesia using\nnociception monitoring devices that are proven effective in\nmonitoring the nociception-antinociception balance during\nsurgery.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Harju et al. [26] reported that no\nincrease in SPI was observed during surgical incision, and the\nresponsiveness of SPI to noxious stimuli was blunted in chil-\ndren undergoing ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal and iliohy-\npogastric nerve block after anesthesia induction for inguinal\nhernia surgery, suggesting that SPI monitoring may be useful\nin discriminating the success of regional analgesia in pedi-\natric patients. Song et al. [99] observed significant changes\nin some HRV parameters after performing a caudal block\nin pediatric patients undergoing urological surgery under\ngeneral anesthesia. They concluded that these HRV changes\nindicated reduced sympathetic activity and increased heart\nrate predictability, suggesting that the assessment of the HRV\nparameters can be an indicator of a successful caudal block.\nMigeon et al. [93] assessed pupillary reflex dilatation and ANI\nmonitoring to evaluate the adequacy of regional analgesia\nwhile performing a neuraxial or peripheral nerve block after\nanesthesia induction in pediatric patients undergoing urolog-\nical and orthopedic surgeries under sevoflurane anesthesia.\nIn patients with a failed nerve block, the pupil diameter in-\ncreased significantly, and ANI decreased within 1 min. There-\nfore, it was suggested that these two nociception monitoring\ntools would be helpful in rapidly and accurately discriminat-\ning the success of regional analgesia in pediatric patients.\nMeanwhile, in a prospective randomized trial performed by\nDundar et al. [100], after performing a thoracic paravertebral\nblock in adult patients undergoing breast surgery under gen-\neral anesthesia, the rate ofremifentanil infusion was adjusted based on ANI monitoring (maintained at 50-70) in an experi-\nmental group for further analgesia during surgery. As a result,\nit was reported that intraoperative remifentanil consumption\nin the experimental group based on ANI was significantly\nlower than that of the control group based on hemodynamic\nparameters, suggesting that ANI monitoring may help opti-\nmize opioid consumption during surgery in these clinical set-\ntings.\n\nComprehensively considering these findings, further stud-\nies are needed in pediatric patients with various regional an-\nalgesia and nociception monitoring devices in various clini-\ncal situations.\n\n# CONCLUSIONS\n\nNociception monitoring tools using ANS activity have been\ndeveloped in several ways. Each monitoring device evaluates\nsympathetic or parasympathetic tone changed by nocicep-\ntion and the monitoring devices share being more effective\nthan conventional hemodynamic parameters. At the same\ntime, depending on which autonomic surrogate marker is\nused, the basic operating principle and characteristics of the\nmonitoring device differ, and their usefulness in various clini-\ncal situations also differs. Therefore, a comprehensive analy-\nsis and understanding of these principles and study results\nare needed. This review analyzes the efficacy and limitations\nof several nociception monitoring devices, mainly focusing\non the intraoperative analgesia in pediatric patients under\ngeneral anesthesia and additionally comparing details about\nclinical conditions such as arousal state, postoperative pain,\nregional analgesia, and includes adult or younger children\n(newborn orinfant) populations when needed.\n\nAlthough most of the nociception monitoring devices\nstill lack studies with pediatric patients, most nociception\nmonitors in children (as in adults) appear to be more useful\nthan the standard clinical practice that uses hemodynamic\nparameters in the evaluation and treatment of intraoperative\nnociception during general anesthesia.\n\nSummarizing the characteristics of each monitoring de-\nvice, SPI seems to be less valid and limited for children than\nfor adults. It may be necessary to apply a lower target value\nrange (maintained below 40) or to develop new formulas\nfitted to children to provide adequate analgesia during sur-\ngery under general anesthesia in children. ANI has shown\n\npromising results in anesthetized adults, and recently posi-\ntive results along with cardiorespiratory coherence have been\nreported in pediatric patients. Especially, NIPE is expected to\nbe useful for providing adequate analgesia in newborns and\ninfants and children under 2 years of age under anesthesia\nor a conscious state. SCA may be best used to assess stress in\nconscious or sedated newborns and younger children, but\nthere is still little evidence of the efficacy ofthe analgesia dur-\ning general anesthesia in pediatric patients. Pupillometry has\nshown reliable results in pediatric patients under anesthesia,\nas in adults, but has some pitfalls, because the measurement\nmay be inaccurate or complicated by a range of factors. It\nhas been reported that ANI performs well compared to other\ndevices on postoperative pain, but there are still suboptimal\nresults. SPI, ANI, and pupillometry may be useful for evaluat-\ning the effects ofregional analgesia performed during general\nanesthesia. In this situation, ANI also enables the optimiza-\ntion of opioid consumption.\n\nA thorough understanding of the pros and cons ofthe noci-\nception monitoring tools summarized above and their appli-\ncation in clinical situations will provide a more effective and\nsafe intraoperative analgesia for pediatric patients undergo-\ning general anesthesia, and it may also facilitate the planning\nand conduct ofresearch on the use of intraoperative nocicep-\ntion monitoring in pediatric patients.
