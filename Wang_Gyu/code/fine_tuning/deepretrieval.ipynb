Accordingly, the authors measured the neuromuscular effects of intramuscular mivacurium in anesthetized infants and children.\", 'Twenty unpremedicated infants and children (3 months to 5 yr of age) were anesthetized with nitrous oxide and halothane and permitted to breathe spontaneously. When anesthetic conditions were stable, mivacurium was injected into the quadriceps or deltoid muscle. Minute ventilation and adductor pollicis twitch tension were measured. The initial mivacurium dose was 250 micrograms/kg and was increased (to a maximum of 800 micrograms/kg, at which dose the trial was ended) or decreased according to the response of the previous patient, the goal being to bracket the dose producing 80-90% twitch depression within 5 min of drug administration.', 'No patient achieved>80% twitch depression within 5 min of mivacurium administration.
