      "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (CCL) in \"Kasabach-Merritt syndrome\" (KMS) (Kaposi-tumor like hemangioendothelioma with case-specific perioperative management).\n",
      "\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS) is characterized by the occurrence of hemangioendothelioma (giant hemangioma with thrombosis leading to thrombocytopenia), which can be associated with disseminated intravasal coagulation. Specific aim: Based on (i) selective references from the current scientific literature and derived recommendations as well as (ii) own experiences obtained in the diagnostic and perioperative management of a representative case from daily practice in abdominal surgery, the specific case undergoing elective cholecystectomy (CCE) in KMS is to be described by means of scientific case report.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: (Patient-, finding- and treatment-specific characteristics): - Medical history: 72-years old female patient with a known KMS of the left arm and upper thorax, recurrent thrombophlebitis of the left arm and thoracic veins, previous upper GI bleeding (Mallory-Weiss syndrome in 2006, chronic anemia in lack of vitamin B12, type-A gastritis, former bleeding complications after teeth extraction/open appendectomy 1962/Caesarean section 1968 with need of transfusion [60 red blood cell packages]), intraabdominal adhesions, hypothyreosis, initial liver cirrhosis. - Symptomatology: Characteristic for cholecystolithiasis (CCL). - Diagnostic: Abdominal ultrasound shows CCL, fibroscan does not confirm suspicious cirrhosis. Laboratory parameters showed: Activation of intravasal coagulation with elevated prothrombin fragments, D-dimers and reduced antiplasmin concentration. Accelerated fibrinolysis capacity; currently, no secondary thrombocytopenia or factor-13 decrease. In addition, fibrinogen concentration within normal range, no hint onto the manifestation of an aquired von-Willebrand's syndrome. - Diagnosis: Chronic fibrosing cholecystitis in CCL after former acute cholecystitis (3 months ago) with indication for surgical intervention. - Therapy: Laparoscopic CCE including careful exploration of upper abdominal cavity for KMS manifestation (with no revision of bile duct) and peritoneal adhesiolysis (histological finding, chronic fibrosing cholecystitis with thickening of the wall of the gall bladder but no hint of malignancy) under perioperative prophylaxis with antibiotics and temporary cessation of platelet medication for 7 d preoperatively, \"bridging\" with low molecular weight heparin (Clexane, 1 × 40 mg s.c.; Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt/Main, Germany); 1 h preoperatively, 15-20 mg/kg body weight Cyclocapron i.v. (once again 6-8 h postoperatively; thereafter, 500 mg of Cyclocapron 4×/d until the 3rd postoperative day). - Intraoperatively: Congestion of veins but not at the immediate surgical field (gall bladder, hepatic bed of the gall bladder, Calot's triangle). - Outcome: Uneventful, in particular, no (bleeding) complications.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: If surgical approach is indicated, the intervention should be thoroughly planned (in particular, under elective circumstances) with regard to hemangioma site and extension as well as distance to the surgical field and possible surgical alternative options (surgical access site, open/laparoscopic approach etc.) to prevent - at the best possible rate - bleeding complications intra-/postoperatively and, thus, to provide adequate patient safety.\n",

      "Treatment experience for different risk groups of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare vascular tumor with a high risk of mortality. Few studies with large samples of KHE have been reported. KHE may develop into the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy. The features of severe symptomatic anemia and life-threatening low platelets make the management of KHE associated with KMP challenging.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics of patients with KHE and discuss the treatment experience for different risk groups of KHE.\n",
      "METHODS: Through a retrospective review of 70 patients diagnosed with KHE between 2017 and 2022 in our center, we classify lesions into three clinicopathological stages based on the tumor involving depth, and divided the severity of KHE into three levels by estimating clinicopathological stages and severity of thrombocytopenia. Treatments of different severity groups were estimated with sufficient data.\n",
      "RESULTS: In our cohort, 27% were neonates, and KHE lesion occurred at birth in 84% of patients. There was a slight male predominance (32 girls and 38 boys). Common clinical characteristics included associated coagulation disorder (100%), locally aggressive cutaneous blue-purple mass (89%), thrombocytopenia (78%), and local pain or joint dysfunction (20%). The lower extremities were the dominant location (35%), followed by the trunk (29%), the maxillofacial region and neck (24%), and the upper extremities (10%). Of the total cohort, 78% developed KMP; the median age at which thrombocytopenia occurred was 27.8 days. The median platelet count of patients who were associated with KMP was 24,000/µL in our cohort. Ninety-two percent of patients were given surgery treatment and 89% of these patients were given high-dose methylprednisolone (5-6 mg/kg daily) before surgery. In 55 patients with KMP, 36% were sensitive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Patients from the low-risk group (eight cases) underwent operation, all of whom recovered without recurrence after a maximum follow-up of 5 years. Out of 26 patients from the high-risk group, 25 underwent surgery treatment, with 1 case undergoing secondary surgery after recurrence and 1 case taking sirolimus. Out of 36 cases from the extremely high-risk group, 32 underwent surgery (including 2 cases who underwent external carotid artery ligation and catheterization), 3 of whom underwent secondary operation after recurrence, and the remaining 4 cases took medicine. The mean length of having sirolimus was 21 months; two cases stopped taking sirolimus due to severe pneumonia. Two cases died at 1 and 3 months after discharge.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the largest assessment of high-risk patients with KHE who have undergone an operation to date, with 5 years of follow-up to track recovery, which provides invaluable knowledge for the future treatment of patients with KHE and KMP from different risk groups: Early surgical intervention may be the most definitive treatment option for most patients with KHE; multimodality treatment is the best choice for the extremely high-risk group.\n",

      "Efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with sirolimus for treating Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in infants, a retrospective study.\n",
      "\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to observe the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sirolimus in the treatment of haemangioma combined with the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP).\n",
      "METHODS: A total of 11 infants with KMP who were treated at our hospital from January 2016 to September 2021 were selected and treated with arteriosclerosis embolotherapy using a microsphere emulsion formed by bleomycin + ultra-fluid lipiodol + dexamethasone + contrast agent or bleomycin mixed microspheres as the embolising agent. The patients were administered sirolimus orally after TACE. The clinical efficacy and examination indicators before and after treatment were observed and compared.\n",
      "RESULTS: The 11 infants underwent TACE treatment by arteriosclerosis embolotherapy a total of 21 times; of these cases, 10 were cured, and 1 showed a moderate response. There were no cases of non-response or death. The platelet count rose from 10.0 (7.0, 18.0) x 109/L before TACE to 236.0 (188.0, 275.0) x 109/L six months after the first TACE, and the tumour size decreased from 49.0 (43.0, 111.7) cm3 before TACE to 7.0 (3.5, 17.0) cm3 six months after the first TACE. The differences were statistically significant (the Z values were -2.943 and -2.934, respectively, p &lt; 0.05).\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The combination of TACE and sirolimus has significant efficacy on critical children with KMP.\n",

      "Single Large-Scale Mitochondrial DNA Deletion Syndromes\n",
      "\n",
      "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletion syndromes (SLSMDSs) comprise overlapping clinical phenotypes including Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), KSS spectrum, Pearson syndrome (PS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), and CPEO-plus. KSS is a progressive multisystem disorder with onset before age 20 years characterized by pigmentary retinopathy, CPEO, and cardiac conduction abnormality. Additional features can include cerebellar ataxia, tremor, intellectual disability or cognitive decline, dementia, sensorineural hearing loss, oropharyngeal and esophageal dysfunction, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and endocrinopathies. Brain imaging typically shows bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus and white matter. KSS spectrum includes individuals with KSS in addition to individuals with ptosis and/or ophthalmoparesis and at least one of the following: retinopathy, ataxia, cardiac conduction defects, hearing loss, growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, tremor, or cardiomyopathy. Compared to CPEO-plus, individuals with KSS spectrum have more severe muscle involvement (e.g., weakness, atrophy) and overall have a worse prognosis. PS is characterized by pancytopenia (typically transfusion-dependent sideroblastic anemia with variable cell line involvement), exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, poor weight gain, and lactic acidosis. PS manifestations also include renal tubular acidosis, short stature, and elevated liver enzymes. PS may be fatal in infancy due to neutropenia-related infection or refractory metabolic acidosis. CPEO is characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, oropharyngeal weakness, variable proximal limb weakness, and/or exercise intolerance. CPEO-plus includes CPEO with additional multisystemic involvement including neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, migraines, hypothyroidism, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and optic neuropathy. Rarely, an SLSMDS can manifest as Leigh syndrome, which is characterized as developmental delays, neurodevelopmental regression, lactic acidosis, and bilateral symmetric basal ganglia, brain stem, and/or midbrain lesions on MRI.\n",
      "DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of an SLSMDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion ranging in size from 1.1 to 10 kb on molecular genetic testing. SLSMDSs can be identified in DNA from blood, buccal cells, and urine in affected children; analysis of skeletal muscle tissue may be required to detect an SLSMDS in an affected adult.\n",
      "MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Folinic acid supplementation in individuals with KSS with low 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in CSF or white matter abnormalities on brain MRI. Supportive care: Consider mitochondrial supplement therapies such as coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> and antioxidants; optimize nutrition and exercise regimen to prevent acute decompensation; physical and occupational therapy for myopathy and/or ataxia; standard treatment with anti-seizure medication; hearing aids or cochlear implants for sensorineural hearing loss; developmental and educational support; feeding therapy; consider gastrostomy tube placement if poor weight gain, choking, or aspiration risk is present; dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter to alleviate cricopharyngeal achalasia; prophylactic placement of cardiac pacemaker in individuals with cardiac conduction block, with consideration of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator; hormone replacement therapy per endocrinologist; electrolyte monitoring and replacement for renal tubular acidosis; eyelid slings and/or ptosis repair for severe ptosis; eye ointment for dry eyes; eyeglass prisms for diplopia; transfusion therapy for individuals with PS with sideroblastic anemia; replacement of pancreatic enzymes for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; ventilatory support for respiratory abnormalities that may occur in individuals with Leigh syndrome; standard treatment of anxiety and/or depression; social work support and care coordination as needed. Surveillance: Annual neurology assessment for ataxia, neuropathy, seizures, and myopathy; annual audiology evaluation; annual assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, and cognitive issues; annual evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist and/or retinal specialist and oculoplastics; measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake at each visit; annual assessment of mobility and self-help skills with physical medicine, occupational therapy, and/or physical therapy; EKG and echocardiogram every six to 12 months; annual assessment with an endocrinologist; BUN and creatinine, with consideration of cystatin C in those with low muscle mass; complete blood count in those with PS to assess transfusion needs with additional labs per hematologist, and ferritin for those needing recurrent transfusions as needed; annual complete blood count in those with other SLSMDSs; fecal fat and fecal elastase as needed based on symptoms; monitor for evidence of aspiration and respiratory insufficiency at each visit; assess family needs at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Volatile anesthetic hypersensitivity may occur. Avoid prolonged treatment with propofol (&gt;30-60 minutes). Medications should be reviewed with a physician familiar with mitochondrial disorders including a thorough individualized assessment of risk vs benefit as several medications may be toxic to mitochondria.\n",
      "GENETIC COUNSELING: SLSMDSs are almost never inherited, suggesting that these disorders are typically caused by a de novo single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletion (SLSMD) that occurs in the mother's oocytes during germline development or in the embryo during embryogenesis. If the mother is clinically unaffected and the proband represents a simplex case (i.e., a single affected family member), the empiric risk to the sibs of a proband is very low (at or below 1%). If the mother is affected, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be approximately 4% (one in 24 births). Maternal transmission to more than one child has not been reported to date. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are scientifically possible but technically prohibitive as next-generation sequencing methodology does not accurately quantify heteroplasmy level of an SLSMD and droplet digital quantitative PCR cannot reliably detect less than 10% heteroplasmy levels of an SLSMD. Further, prenatal testing is not clinically available due to the inability to accurately interpret the clinical prognosis based on prenatal diagnostic results of an SLSMD.\n",

      "Kawasaki disease presented with status epilepticus and diffusion MRI abnormalities in the subcortical white matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, self-limited vasculitis of unknown etiology that occurs predominantly in infants and young children. Encephalitis/encephalopathy is an extremely rare complication of KD.\n",
      "CASE: A previously healthy 8-month-old Japanese boy had a prolonged seizure after febrile illness for one day. On the fourth day, he had bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, changes in the extremities, rash and induration at the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin inoculation site. He was diagnosed with incomplete KD and treated with immunoglobulin. On the fifth day, he had cluster seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed restricted diffusion in the left subcortical white matter, which was consistent with acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD). He was treated with controlled normothermia, pulseddose methylprednisolone, continuous infusion of midazolam, and edaravone. On the tenth day, he had a recurrent fever and was treated with a second course of immunoglobulin. Subsequently, he had defervescence, and the abnormal signal detected in the MRI disappeared. At the age of 11 months, he had normal growth and development for his age by the Denver Developmental Screening Test.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: It is necessary to consider AESD as the differential diagnosis of prolonged seizure in infants with KD. Brain MRI led to early diagnosis and intervention in our patient. The neurological prognosis of our patient was relatively good, but the prognosis of KD with AESD is unknown. To clarify this, further case accumulation is warranted.\n",

      "Skeletal defects and bone metabolism in Noonan, Costello and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noonan, Costello and Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes belong to a group of disorders named RASopathies due to their common pathogenetic origin that lies on the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Genetics has eased, at least in part, the distinction of these entities as they are presented with overlapping clinical features which, sometimes, become more pronounced with age. Distinctive face, cardiac and skeletal defects are among the primary abnormalities seen in these patients. Skeletal dysmorphisms range from mild to severe and may include anterior chest wall anomalies, scoliosis, kyphosis, short stature, hand anomalies, muscle weakness, osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Patients usually have increased serum concentrations of bone resorption markers, while markers of bone formation are within normal range. The causative molecular defects encompass the members of the Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway and the adjacent cascades, important for the maintenance of normal bone homeostasis. It has been suggested that modulation of the expression of specific molecules involved in the processes of bone remodeling may affect the osteogenic fate decision, potentially, bringing out new pharmaceutical targets. Currently, the laboratory imprint of bone metabolism on the clinical picture of the affected individuals is not clear, maybe due to the rarity of these syndromes, the small number of the recruited patients and the methods used for the description of their clinical and biochemical profiles.\n",

      "KCNQ2 mutation in an infant with encephalopathy of infancy with migrating focal seizures.\n",
      "\n",
      "A male neonate presented with seizures at 18 hours of life, characterized by tonic posturing with eye deviation to the right, apnoea, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation. Initial structural, metabolic, and infectious work-up was unremarkable. He continued to have seizures refractory to a variety of antiepileptic medications. A phenobarbital coma was trialled, leading to cessation of clinical seizures but continuation of electrographic status epilepticus. On EEG, ictal discharges originated from both the right and left hemispheres, migrating to the opposite hemisphere, consistent with encephalopathy of infancy with migrating focal seizures. At this time, he developed septic shock and was trialled on a ketamine infusion and ketogenic diet. Due to his poor prognosis, a goals of care discussion was carried out with the family, leading to withdrawal of care and his subsequent death at one month and seven days. A posthumous genetic panel revealed a de novo KCNQ2 p.Ser247Leu variant, considered likely to be pathogenic. This is the third reported case of a KCNQ2 mutation associated with an encephalopathy of infancy with migrating focal seizures phenotype. We discuss potential cellular mechanisms underlying this unique KCNQ2 phenotype, as well as future therapeutic considerations.\n",

      "Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome with Congenital Glaucoma Caused by Novel TREX1 Mutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, white matter lesions, numerous intracranial calcifications, chilblain skin lesions and high levels of interferon-α (IFN-α) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, ocular involvement is reported significantly less frequently.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a neonate with hypotrophy, microcephaly, frostbite-like skin lesions, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes and hepatosplenomegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple foci of calcification, white matter changes, cerebral atrophy, and atrophic dilatation of the ventricular system. The inflammatory parameters were not elevated, and the infectious etiology was excluded. Instead, elevated levels of IFN-α in the serum were detected. Based on the related clinical symptoms, imaging and test findings, the diagnosis of AGS was suspected. Genetic testing revealed two pathogenic mutations, c.490C&gt;T and c.222del (novel mutation), in the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) gene, confirming AGS type 1 (AGS1). An ophthalmologic examination of the child at 10 months of age revealed an impaired pupillary response to light, a corneal haze with Haab lines in the right eye (RE), pale optic nerve discs and neuropathy in both eyes (OU). The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 51 mmHg in the RE and 49 in the left eye (LE). The flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) showed prolonged P2 latencies of up to 125% in the LE and reduced amplitudes of up to approximately 10% OU. This girl was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma, and it was managed with a trabeculectomy with a basal iridectomy of OU, resulting in a reduction and stabilization in the IOP to 12 mmHg in the RE and 10 mmHg in the LE without any hypotensive eyedrops.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We present the clinical characteristics, electrophysiological and imaging findings, as well as the genetic test results of a patient with AGS1. Our case contributes to the extended ophthalmic involvement of the pathogenic c.490C&gt;T and c.222del mutations in TREX1.\n",
