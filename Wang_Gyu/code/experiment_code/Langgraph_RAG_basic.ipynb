Introduction\\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein\\nthrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and its\\nlong-term complications cause signiﬁcant morbidity, mortality\\nand healthcare costs [1–3]. The risk of VTE is particularly\\nhigh in patients who undergo major orthopedic surgery, such\\nas total knee or hip replacement surgery [4]; therefore, these\\npatients routinely receive anticoagulants for short-term peri-\\noperative and postoperative thromboprophylaxis [4,5].\\nWhether a patient is receiving long-term anticoagulation (for\\nthe treatment or prevention of VTE or for stroke prevention\\nin patients with non-valvular atrial ﬁbrillation [AF]) prior to\\northopedic surgery should also be considered because appro-\\npriate anticoagulant management based on the risk of throm-\\nboembolism and bleeding is crucial in these patients [5].\\nAdditionally, the use of regional neuraxial anesthesia poses a\\nrisk of hematoma in patients receiving anticoagulants, because\\nof the insertion and removal of the needle and catheter.\\nThe direct oral anticoagulants (OACs) apixaban, rivaroxa-\\nban, and dabigatran are approved for the prevention of VTE\\nafter elective knee or hip replacement surgery in the European\\nUnion and/or United States, as well as for the prevention of'),\n",

In Europe,\\nrivaroxaban is also indicated for co-administration with acetyl-\\nsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or\\nticlopidine for the prevention of atherothrombotic events after\\nacute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers\\n[10]. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor\\nXa, whereas dabigatran is a direct inhibitor of thrombin.\\nAll three agents have been found to exhibit predictable\\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and have a fast\\nonset of action—reaching maximum plasma concentration\\nrapidly after oral administration (apixaban, 3-4 hours; rivarox-\\naban, 2-4 hours; dabigatran, 0.5-2.0 hours) [6,8,10,12–15].\\nThe half-lives of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are\\n~ 12 hours, 5-13 hours, and 11-14 hours, respectively\\n[6,8,10]. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-\\nnamic characteristics are not inﬂuenced to a clinically mean-\\ningful extent by body weight, age, or gender, which\\ncollectively indicate that these direct OACs can be given as\\nﬁxed dosing regimens without the need for routine coagulation\\nmonitoring [16–20]. The routes of drug elimination differ be-\\ntween the 2 drug classes: apixaban and rivaroxaban have mul-\\ntiple pathways including renal excretion (~ 27% and 66%\\n[33% as active drug and 33% after metabolic degradation], re-\\nspectively), whereas elimination of dabigatran is predominant-\\nly via the renal system (85%) [6,8,10,21]. In patients receiving\\ndabigatran for the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replace-\\nment surgery, a dose reduction is required in those with mod-\\nerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min−1),\\nthose aged 75 years or over, and those taking concomitant\\nmild-to-moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors [8]. Owing to their\\nmode of action, all anticoagulants can increase the risk of\\nbleeding events. However, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabiga-\\ntran did not pose any signiﬁcantly increased risk of major\\nbleeding events compared with enoxaparin in phase III clinical\\ntrials in the prevention of VTE after knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery [22–30]. Despite the clinical evidence on the safety\\nand efﬁcacy proﬁle of direct OACs demonstrated in clinical trials,\\nphysicians—particularly anesthesiologists—need to be aware of\\nhow to minimize the risks of bleeding complications when treat-\\ning patients who are taking an anticoagulant and are due to under-\\ngo surgery with regional anesthesia.\\nRegional anesthesia techniques have become increasingly pop-\\nular because they offer several beneﬁts over general anesthesia and\\ntraditional systemic analgesia, including reduced risk of mortality\\nand less postoperative pain, thus facilitating early postoperative\\nmobilization of the limbs and consequently reducing the chances\\nof postoperative VTE [31,32]. Regional anesthesia is used in\\nmillions of operations each year and, at a time when the use\\nof the direct OACs is growing, bleeding-related complications\\ncould arise if appropriate guidance is not followed [33]. This\\nreview aims to provide anesthesiologists with an overview of\\ncurrent data on the risk of hemorrhagic complications with\\ndirect OACs when using regional anesthesia, particularly\\nin patients at a high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery. Moreover, current guideline\\nrecommendations will be discussed and best practice in speciﬁc\\nclinical situations, such as in patients with renal impairment who\\nare at an increased risk of bleeding, will be highlighted.\\n# 2. Regional anesthesia and complications\\nThe most common complications of regional anesthesia\\ninclude postdural puncture headache (occurs in 0.1%-36% of\\npatients but rarely lasts longer than 7 days) [34], backache (af-\\nfects up to 11% of patients in the 5 days after the procedure)\\n[35], and peripheral nerve damage (eg, transient paresthesia\\nis estimated in up to 8%-10% of patients in the immediate days\\nafter regional anesthesia) [36]. Serious complications, such as\\nspinal or epidural hematoma and epidural abscess, are rare and\\ntherefore difﬁcult to study in detail [37]. For peripheral nerve\\nblock, neurological complications are extremely rare, ranging\\nbetween 0.02% and 0.04% [38,39].\\n2.1. Risk factors associated with regional anesthesia\\nIn a systematic review of 141 studies (n = 9559),\\nneuraxial anesthesia was shown to be associated with lower\\nrates of mortality (2.1% vs 3.1%; odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95%\\nconﬁdence interval [CI] 0.54-0.90; P = .006), occurrence of\\nDVT (odds reduction of 44%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.72;\\nP b .001) and PE (odds reduction of 55%; OR 0.45; 95% CI\\n0.29-0.69; P b .001), among other outcomes [31]. A more re-\\ncent observational study showed that neuraxial anesthesia was\\nassociated with a signiﬁcantly reduced need for blood transfu-\\nsions compared with patients receiving general anesthesia\\n(28.5% vs 44.7%; OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.45-0.61; P b .0001) af-\\nter simultaneous bilateral total knee replacement surgery [40].\\n2.2. Risk factors for the development of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe overall incidences of hematoma in patients receiving\\nneuraxial anesthesia (epidural and spinal) have been estimated\\nto be as low as 1 in 220 000 and 1 in 320 000, respectively, in\\nthe absence of traumatic puncture and without the use of hep-\\narin or ASA [41]. However, the incidence of spinal hematoma\\nincreases with the presence of any risk factors, listed in Table 1,\\nand more so if heparin anticoagulation is accompanied by trau-\\nmatic puncture (increasing incidence rates to 1 in 2000 and 1\\nin 2900 for epidural and spinal anesthesia, respectively). For\\nASA therapy the risk is 1 in 8500 and 1 in 12 000 for epidural\\nand spinal anesthesia, respectively [41,42]. An incidence of\\nbetween 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 has been estimated for neur-\\naxial hematoma after central neural blockade in patients under-\\ngoing orthopedic procedures and receiving preoperative\\nthromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin [43]. A recent review\\nassessing spinal/epidural anesthesia complications in Finland\\nfrom 2000 to 2009 showed the risk of developing a serious\\ncomplication (deﬁned as a potentially fatal event or an event\\nof over 1 year in duration, including epidural hematoma) after'),\n",

Of the 13 cases of neuraxial hematoma reported\\nfrom a total of 1.4 million procedures involving neuraxial\\ncentral blocks, 10 were associated with thromboprophylaxis\\n(enoxaparin, dalteparin, or fondaparinux); however, for\\n6 of 10 of these occurrences, the time elapsed between\\ncessation/initiation of thromboprophylaxis and puncture may\\nnot have been sufﬁcient to prevent a bleeding event [44]. A\\nrecent retrospective study on the safety of epidural and spinal\\nneuraxial block showed that the incidence of perioperative\\nneurological complications in orthopedic patients was rela-\\ntively low (0.96/1000; 95% CI 0.77-1.16/1000), but was\\nhigher than previously reported in other non-obstetric popula-\\ntions [45]. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of\\nclinically signiﬁcant bleeding causing spinal hematoma can\\nbe divided into patient-, drug-, and procedure-related catego-\\nries (Table 1).\\n2.3. Patient-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nRegarding patient-related factors, clinicians must exercise\\nparticular care with elderly patients requiring surgical inter-\\nvention—these patients are at increased risk of thrombo-\\nembolic disorders [46,47] and are, therefore, more likely to\\nbe receiving anticoagulants. Furthermore, the bleeding risk in\\nelderly patients receiving anticoagulants is augmented\\n[48,49]. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or he-\\npatic impairment, causing increased drug plasma concentrations,\\nand consequently drug elimination may be slower in these\\npatients [50]. Real-world data from the RIETE (Registro Infor-\\nmatizado de Pacientes con Enfermedad TromboEmbólica)\\nregistry have shown major and fatal bleeding to be more com-\\nmon in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who were\\naged ≥ 80 years compared with those aged b 80 years (3.4%\\nvs 2.1% and 0.8% vs 0.4%, respectively) [51]. Therefore,\\nknowledge about the metabolism of the direct OACs approved\\nfor VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery is essential\\nwhen deciding which anticoagulant to prescribe to a particular\\npatient. Whereas the metabolism of dabigatran is mostly\\ndependent on renal clearance, the metabolism of apixaban\\nand rivaroxaban involves multiple pathways and is less\\ndependent on renal function (Table 2). The high frequency of\\nco-medication use in elderly patients also increases both the\\npotential for drug-drug interactions and the risk of bleeding [52].\\n2.4. Drug-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nSome drug interactions of anticoagulants might increase the\\nrisk of bleeding complications, including the risk of spinal hema-\\ntoma.

For all 3 direct OACs, care\\nshould be taken when co-administering with non-steroidal\\nanti-inﬂammatory drugs, ASA, or platelet aggregation inhibi-\\ntors, which may increase bleeding risk [6,10].\\n2.5. Procedural-related factors increasing the risk of\\nspinal hematoma\\nThe risk of spinal hematoma has also been associated with\\nprocedural factors, including unintentional needle/catheter-\\nrelated mechanical damage of neural or vascular components\\nof the spine due to a difﬁcult or traumatic spinal procedure\\n[53–55]. The patient characteristics also have an inﬂuence\\non procedure-related risk factors; for example, aging is associ-\\nated with skeletal degeneration that may make the anesthesia\\nprocedure technically more difﬁcult [56].\\n3. Inﬂuence of anesthesia in patients receiving\\ndirect oral anticoagulants: evidence from\\nphase III clinical studies with a focus on\\nmajor orthopedic surgery\\nGiven the increasing utilization of direct OACs for the\\ntreatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders, it is\\ncrucial to evaluate the risk of compressive hematoma and the\\nimpact on clinical outcomes when regional anesthesia is used.\\nTo discuss the effect of regional anesthesia on the risk of com-\\npressive hematoma and bleeding risk, we searched PubMed\\nwith no date restrictions for phase III clinical trials comparing\\n‘apixaban’, ‘rivaroxaban’, or ‘dabigatran’ with ‘standard of\\ncare’/‘low molecular weight heparin’ for ‘VTE prevention’/\\n‘thromboprophylaxis’ after ‘total knee or hip replacement\\nsurgery’/‘knee or hip arthroplasty’ and for studies investigating\\n‘spinal hematoma’ after ‘regional anesthesia’.\\nIt is worth noting the risk of spinal hematoma with regional\\nanesthesia when receiving traditional anticoagulants. Vitamin\\nK antagonist therapy is a contraindication for neuraxial\\nanesthesia, owing to the high risk of bleeding associated with\\ntherapeutic doses [57]. The risk of spinal hematoma in patients\\nreceiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) concomi-\\ntantly with epidural anesthesia is reported to be 1:6600 for\\nsingle-shot epidural and 1:3100 with an indwelling catheter\\nfor the LMWH dosage of 30 mg twice daily and 1:18 000\\nfor a 40 mg once-daily dosage [57,58]. There are fewer data\\nfor ASA, but it has been demonstrated that medical patients\\nreceiving daily doses above 100 mg are at increased risk of\\nhemorrhagic complications [59].\\nCentral nerve blocks have been classiﬁed as a high bleed-\\ning risk procedure owing to their rare but severe complication,\\neg, spinal-epidural hematoma [60,61]. Because of the absence\\nof evidence-based data, when neuraxial procedures are\\nperformed in these conditions, a systematic follow-up of these\\npatients and a heightened awareness of bleeding complications\\nshould be observed.\\n3.1. Apixaban\\nStudies speciﬁcally designed to investigate the relationship\\nbetween anesthesia and spinal hematoma risk in patients\\nreceiving apixaban are lacking. However, phase III clinical\\ntrials comparing apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with subcuta-\\nneous enoxaparin (30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily)\\nfor VTE prevention after total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nfound that apixaban was as effective as or better than enoxa-\\nparin at reducing the risk of the composite of VTE or death\\nwith similar or lower rates of bleeding [22–24]. In these 3\\ntrials, 15.8% of patients randomized to apixaban had regional\\nanesthesia. Experience of apixaban use in the presence of\\nneuraxial blockade is limited and, according to its product label\\nand guidance from the European Society of Anaesthesiology\\n(ESA), should only be done with extreme caution [6,57].\\n# 3.2. Rivaroxaban\\nThe incidences of intraspinal bleeding or hemorrhagic\\npuncture were included under the deﬁnition for major bleed-\\ning used in the RECORD (REgulation of Coagulation in\\nORthopaedic surgery to prevent Deep vein thrombosis and\\npulmonary embolism) clinical trial program of rivaroxaban\\n[27,62]. A post hoc analysis assessed 12 729 randomized\\npatients in the pooled RECORD1-4 program undergoing elec-\\ntive total knee or hip replacement surgery for events related to\\nneuraxial anesthesia, such as neuraxial hematoma [62].\\nThromboprophylactic therapy was provided to patients as\\neither oral rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily, initiated 6-8 hours\\nafter surgery) or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily,\\nstarted 12 hours prior to surgery, or 30 mg twice daily, started\\n12-24 hours after surgery) [62]. Although 66% of patients\\n(safety population, n = 12 383) received neuraxial anesthesia\\n(9% of patients also received general anesthesia), only 1\\ncompressive hematoma after epidural catheter removal was\\nrecorded. This event occurred after elective total knee replace-\\nment surgery in a patient treated with enoxaparin, who was at\\nincreased risk of bleeding as a result of advanced age and renal\\ninsufﬁciency. The patient was adequately managed with a\\nlaminectomy without further bleeding or neurological\\ncomplications [62]. The type of anesthesia (spinal with or\\nwithout general anesthesia, epidural, epidural with indwelling\\ncatheter, general or spinal with femoral block, or general\\nalone) had no inﬂuence on the rates of total venous thrombo-\\nembolic events, which were lower with rivaroxaban than with\\nstandard of care [62].'),\n",

Neuraxial\\nanesthesia was associated with a slightly lower rate of\\nsymptomatic thromboembolic events compared with general\\nanesthesia in patients undergoing elective total knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery [62]. However, available experience\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade remains limited,\\nand real risk is difﬁcult to evaluate owing to the low incidences\\nof spinal and epidural hematoma in this setting. The ESA\\nguidelines, published before the completion of the relevant\\nRECORD subanalysis, recommend extreme caution when\\nusing rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade [57]. The\\nAmerican Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine\\n(ASRA) guidelines for dabigatran, as well as rivaroxaban,\\nare still being evaluated. These guidelines do not provide\\ndetailed information for the management of anticoagulation\\nwith direct OACs owing to a lack of available information\\non block performance [41].\\n# 3.3. Dabigatran\\nAn analysis of the pooled population of patients from the\\nphase III RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and RE-MOBILIZE\\nstudies who underwent major hip or knee replacement surgery\\nand received thromboprophylaxis with dabigatran (220 mg or\\n150 mg once daily) or enoxaparin showed a higher use of neur-\\naxial anesthesia (n = 4212; 52%) compared with general anes-\\nthesia (n = 2311; 29%) or combination anesthesia, namely,\\nneuraxial or general anesthesia combined with a peripheral\\nnerve block (n = 1539; 19%) [63]. The use of neuraxial anes-\\nthesia was not associated with neuraxial hematoma—no cases\\nwere reported [63]. The efﬁcacy and safety outcomes of the\\ndabigatran groups did not differ from those of the standard\\ntherapy groups, and were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the\\ntype of anesthesia used [63]. A reduced incidence of major\\nVTE and VTE-related mortality was observed with neuraxial\\nanesthesia compared with general anesthesia (4.2% vs 3.1%;\\nOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.03-1.90; P = .035) in the overall population,\\nbut no signiﬁcant differences or clear trends were recorded\\nregarding the safety outcomes of major bleeding or major\\nand non-major clinically relevant bleeding between the types\\nof anesthesia [63]. Experience with combined use of neuraxial\\nblockade and dabigatran is restricted by its manufacturer's\\nadvice against this, as stated by the ESA guidelines [8,57].\\n4. Management of direct oral anticoagulants and\\nneuraxial anesthesia in major orthopedic surgery\\nManagement strategies must balance the surgical risk of\\nhematoma in the anesthetized patient with effective thrombo-\\nprophylaxis. Understanding the pharmacodynamic and\\npharmacokinetic properties of an anticoagulant and the inﬂu-\\nence of patient age and hepatic and renal function is essential.\\nProviding neuraxial anesthesia and the timing of needle/catheter\\ninsertion/removal in patients who are receiving or are to receive\\nanticoagulant therapy involves individual assessment of the\\nrisks and beneﬁts of such a procedure, together with rigorous\\nmanagement of anticoagulation activity and monitoring for\\nsigns of neurological dysfunction. It is of the utmost importance\\nto ensure that the anticoagulation effect is adequately reduced\\nbefore proceeding with a neuraxial block. It is possible to\\nmeasure the effect of the direct OACs either qualitatively or\\nquantitatively, if required.\\n4.1. Perioperative management of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nAdequate protocols for interrupting and resuming thrombo-\\nprophylaxis based on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct\\nOACs are essential. Clinical practice guidelines, such as those of\\nthe ESA [57]), ASRA [41], and the Scandinavian Society of\\nAnaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI) [64], pro-\\nvide recommendations for the regional anesthetic management\\nof patients undergoing surgery and requiring anticoagulation,\\nincluding with direct OACs (Table 3). These recommenda-\\ntions, based on data from clinical trials, the pharmacokinetic\\nproﬁle of each anticoagulant, and from clinical experience, ad-\\nvise a waiting time between interrupting anticoagulation and\\nperforming neuraxial blockade that depends on the elimination\\nhalf-life of the anticoagulant agent [57]. The percentages of\\ndrug remaining in the circulation after 1-6 half-lives are\\n50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.3%, 3.1%, and 1.6%, respectively [65].\\nA recommendation for a waiting period of 2 half-lives, to re-\\nduce the bioavailability of an anticoagulant to less than 25%,\\ndoes not take into consideration how the half-life elimination\\nof a drug is inﬂuenced by patient characteristics. Patients\\nwho undergo joint replacement surgery are typically elderly,\\noften with renal impairment and receiving antiplatelet therapy;\\nfor these patients, a waiting time of 3-5 half-lives could be\\nmore appropriate if hemostatic safety is not assured (Table 4).\\nTo prevent VTE after major orthopedic surgery, the direct\\nOACs have to be administered in the postoperative period\\nwhen adequate hemostasis has been established, as determined\\nby the treating physician.\\nRecently, the direct OACs have been approved for long-term\\nprevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular AF, and\\nfor the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE.

No further recommendations were\\nprovided by the ASRA for management of anticoagulation\\nwith apixaban in the context of elective orthopedic surgery\\n[41]. The SSAI guidelines state that the lack of data prevents\\nany recommendation being made regarding the use of apixa-\\nban and central neuraxial block, although a period of 6 hours\\nshould be observed between central neuraxial block or catheter\\nmanipulation and ﬁrst dose of this anticoagulant [64].\\n4.1.2. Perioperative management of rivaroxaban\\n4.1.2.1. Interruption of rivaroxaban before surgery. The\\nSummary of Product Characteristics of rivaroxaban suggest\\nin patients with normal renal function a minimum of 24 hours\\nbetween the last therapeutic dose of the anticoagulant and the\\nstart of the surgery [10]. For patients with severe renal impair-\\nment, many authors recommend an interval of up to 4-5 days\\n[60,67,68]. Imberti et al suggested a discontinuation of rivar-\\noxaban at least 48 hours prior to procedures involving a\\nstandard risk of bleeding, such as orthopedic surgery; for\\nprocedures with a high risk of bleeding (neuraxial block),\\nrivaroxaban should be stopped 72 hours before the intervention\\n[69]. In the authors' opinion, patients with AF with standard\\nbleeding risk (HAS-BLED score b 3) could undergo neuraxial\\nanesthesia 48 hours after the last rivaroxaban intake, whereas\\nin patients with high bleeding risk, neuraxial anesthesia should\\nbe delayed for 4 days, and this type of anesthesia should not be\\nconsidered in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine\\nclearance b 30 mL min−1) [69].\\nIn patients receiving ongoing rivaroxaban, if a central block\\nwith an indwelling catheter is used, the SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 18 hours between the last dose of\\nrivaroxaban and removal of an indwelling catheter [64].\\nBecause of the prolongation of the half-life in elderly patients,\\nthe ESA guidelines recommend a longer interval (22-26 hours)\\nbetween the last dose of rivaroxaban and removal of an\\nindwelling catheter [57]. These 2 recommendations are in\\nagreement with those in the report by Rosencher et al, which\\nrecommends 2 half-lives between rivaroxaban discontinuation\\nand epidural catheter removal [66]. Furthermore, these guide-\\nlines highlight the fact that patients receiving anti-hemostatic\\ndrugs and with impaired drug elimination, such as those with\\nrenal impairment, may require waiting times to be prolonged\\n[64]. The ASRA guidelines issued for rivaroxaban recom-\\nmend a cautious approach owing to the lack of information\\non the speciﬁcs (needle placement or catheter management)\\nof block performance and the prolonged half-life in elderly pa-\\ntients resulting from deterioration of renal function, even in the\\nabsence of any reported spinal hematoma [41].\\n4.1.2.2. Resumption of rivaroxaban after surgery. Rivar-\\noxaban should be started 6-10 hours after the end of surgery,\\nprovided hemostasis is achieved [10]. The SSAI guidelines\\nrecommend a minimum of 6 hours between central neuraxial\\nblock and initiation of rivaroxaban, or a delay of 24 hours if\\na traumatic puncture occurred during the performance of\\ncentral nerve block [10,64].

Interruption of dabigatran before surgery.\\ndabigatran Summary of Product Characteristics recommends\\ndiscontinuation of the anticoagulant for ≥ 2 days before elec-\\ntive surgery that carries a high risk of bleeding or is considered\\nto be ‘major’ surgery, depending on the patient's renal\\nfunction [8]. High-risk procedures, including cardiac surgery,\\nneurosurgery, abdominal surgery, or procedures requiring\\nspinal anesthesia, may require cessation of dabigatran 2-4 days\\nbefore surgery in patients with normal renal function and ≥ 4\\ndays before surgery in patients with moderate renal impair-\\nment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL min− 1) [70]. Based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, a time inter-\\nval of 36 hours (skipping 1 dose) between the last dose of dabi-\\ngatran and puncture/catheter removal is suggested [66], but\\nthis has not been studied or conﬁrmed.\\nThe\\n4.1.3.2. Resumption of dabigatran after surgery. Pro-\\nvided hemostasis is achieved, dabigatran should be started 1-4\\nhours after the end of surgery [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend against the use of dabigatran in the presence of neuraxial\\nblockade, as also advised in the dabigatran Summary of\\nProduct Characteristics [8]. If neuraxial anesthesia is used,\\nthe ﬁrst dose of dabigatran should not be administered within\\n2 hours of catheter removal, in accordance with the Summary\\nof Product Characteristics [8]. The ESA guidelines recom-\\nmend a waiting time of 6 hours after catheter removal before\\nre-initiating anticoagulation with dabigatran [57]. However,\\nthe ASRA guidelines state simply that caution must be taken\\nowing to the paucity of information on the performance of\\nneuraxial block and the prolonged half-life of this anticoagu-\\nlant after multiple doses or in patients with renal impairment,\\ndespite the absence of spinal hematomas reported up to the\\npublication of these guidelines [41]. The SSAI guidelines\\nmake the sole recommendation of waiting for at least 6 hours\\nafter a central neuraxial block or catheter removal before\\nthe ﬁrst dose of dabigatran is taken [64]. However, based on\\nthe pharmacokinetic characteristics of dabigatran, it may be\\nprudent to wait at least 12 hours after catheter removal before\\nadministration of dabigatran [66].\\n4.2. Laboratory measurement of direct\\noral anticoagulants\\nIn the context of perioperative management of patients who\\nare receiving a direct OAC, the concentration of the direct\\nOAC can be determined if, for example, an emergency\\nsurgical intervention is required by an anticoagulated patient.\\nHowever, it is important to take into account the timing of\\nthe last dose in relation to blood sampling time when interpreting\\nthe test results [71].\\n4.2.1. Laboratory measurement of apixaban\\nThe quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations of\\napixaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa chromogenic\\nassays and adequate standard calibration curves [72].\\nAlthough apixaban prolongs prothrombin time (PT), it is not\\nsuitable for measuring the anticoagulant effect of apixaban\\nand there is no known relationship with bleeding risk [71].\\n4.2.2. Laboratory measurement of rivaroxaban\\nThe PT can be used to determine the relative anticoagulant\\nactivity of rivaroxaban [71,73]. However, PT is not speciﬁc\\nand can be inﬂuenced by factors such as cancer, hepatic\\nimpairment, and vitamin K deﬁciency [74,75]. Furthermore,\\nthere is marked variability in the sensitivity of the reagents\\navailable for obtaining PT results for rivaroxaban; only a\\nsensitive reagent, such as Neoplastin Plus (Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnières-sur-Seine, France), should be used [76]. Importantly,\\nthe international normalized ratio must not be used for rivarox-\\naban. The quantitative measurement of plasma concentrations\\nof rivaroxaban can be performed using anti-Factor Xa\\nchromogenic assays (eg, STA Rotachrom, Diagnostica Stago,\\nAsnières-sur-Seine, France) with validated calibrators [77].\\nWhen anti-Factor Xa assays are unavailable, a PT test with a\\nreagent sensitive to rivaroxaban may be used to conﬁrm the\\nabsence or presence of an anticoagulant effect (if the sampling\\ntime after last tablet intake is known) [76,78,79].\\n4.2.3. Laboratory measurement of dabigatran\\nThe activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, for\\nexample, provides a qualitative measure of the anticoagulant\\neffect of dabigatran [73]. Unfortunately, aPTT is inﬂuenced\\nby the coagulometers and reagents used [75]. In the case of\\naPTT results for dabigatran, there is reasonable agreement\\nregardless of the reagent composition, and results are within\\n10% of reference measurements [70]. The aPTT assay may be\\nuseful in dabigatran-treated patients who require emergency\\ninterventions to exclude any clinically relevant dabigatran\\nanticoagulant effect [71,80]. The ecarin clotting time (ECT)\\nassay provides a direct measurement of the activity of dabiga-\\ntran, but is not readily available [71]. Calibrated ecarin chro-\\nmogenic assays are also available (eg, Ecarin Chromogenic\\nAssay, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) and\\nmay allow faster ECT measurements than the ECT assay\\n[71]. Direct thrombin inhibitor assays (such as the\\nHEMOCLOT assay, HYPHEN BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,\\nFrance) can be used for the quantitative measurement of\\nplasma concentrations of dabigatran [81]. In the absence of\\nthis assay, an aPTT test can be used [82].\\n5.

Assessment of neurological\\nfunction is the most reliable method for detecting neurological\\ninjury, because standard laboratory tests may not provide ade-\\nquate information about the coagulation status of a patient\\n[83,84]. Monitoring of neurological function during regional\\nanesthesia alongside anticoagulant therapy is essential—but\\nmay not be sufﬁcient—to improve neurological outcomes.\\nBased on the pharmacokinetic properties of the direct OACs\\nand their rapid onset of action (within a few hours), conﬁning\\nthe assessment of neurological function to the period between\\ncatheter removal or neuraxial puncture and 4 hours after\\nthe initiation of therapy may seem reasonable. However, a\\nlonger period of time during which neurological function\\nshould be assessed may be required, because the development\\nof neurological injury may be slow, with the onset of\\nneurological symptoms potentially taking as long as 3 or more\\ndays [55].\\n6. Use of non-neuraxial regional techniques and\\ndirect oral anticoagulants in clinical practice\\nTotal knee and hip replacement surgery causes intense\\npostoperative pain, which may impair rehabilitation and mobi-\\nlization, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of VTE\\n[85]. The use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (femoral\\nand lumbar plexus blocks) for hip and knee surgery may offer\\nadvantages as a ﬁrst strategy to balance the risk of hematoma\\nin anticoagulated patients compared with epidural analgesia.\\nThe results from a systematic review of randomized controlled\\ntrials support the use of peripheral nerve blocks as a ﬁrst\\nchoice of analgesia after major orthopedic surgery; femoral\\nnerve block provided a similar analgesic proﬁle to epidural\\nanalgesia, with fewer side-effects after total knee replacement sur-\\ngery [86]. Lumbar plexus block represents the ﬁrst analgesic\\nchoice after total hip replacement surgery [87]. However, both\\nlumbar plexus and femoral nerve blocks are still associated\\nwith loss of quadricep muscle strength [88,89]. A study has\\nsuggested that an adductor canal block after knee surgery\\nmay provide a similar analgesic proﬁle but without quadricep\\nweakness after total knee replacement surgery [88]. Although\\nno difference was observed between the 2 anesthesia tech-\\nniques in terms of morphine use or level of pain, quadricep\\nstrength was signiﬁcantly better preserved with an adductor\\ncanal block than with a femoral nerve block (52% median of\\nbaseline vs 18%, P = .004) [88]. Peripheral nerve blocks have\\nbeen associated with a potential for wound hematoma with\\nadministration of heparin in some studies [57,90–93] but not\\nothers [94]. The potential severity of a hematoma in a non-\\ncompressible site and the lack of evidence on which to base\\nrecommendations for the particular use of continuous periph-\\neral nerve blocks have led the ESA and ASRA guidelines to\\nsuggest expanding the clinical recommendations for neuraxial\\nanesthesia to deeper peripheral nerve blocks, such as lumbar\\nplexus [41,57].\\nStudies speciﬁcally investigating the use of apixaban after\\nnon-neuraxial blocks in orthopedic surgery seem to be lacking.\\nHowever, there are some available data for rivaroxaban\\nand dabigatran. In a prospective observational study of 504\\npatients undergoing total knee replacement surgery who had\\ncontinuous femoral nerve block and whose femoral catheter\\nwas removed 20 hours after starting rivaroxaban (10 mg once\\ndaily), no incidences of hematoma causing neurovascular\\ncompromise at the femoral catheter site or groin area were\\nreported [95]. Neither was rivaroxaban associated with an\\nincrease in major bleeding in an observational analysis of\\n766 patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery\\nand femoral, sciatic, and lumbar plexus blocks, although 3\\nhematomas in the operated knee requiring surgical evacuation\\nwere noted during rivaroxaban administration [96].\\nIn a post hoc pooled analysis of 3 phase III clinical trials of\\ndabigatran (220 mg or 150 mg once daily) versus enoxaparin\\nfor VTE prevention after knee or hip replacement surgery, in\\nwhich 19% (n = 1539) received a combination of general anes-\\nthesia or neuraxial anesthesia plus peripheral nerve block, rates\\nof major VTE and VTE-related mortality were slightly higher\\nwith general anesthesia compared with neuraxial or combina-\\ntion anesthesia, although not signiﬁcantly so, and neither were\\nthere signiﬁcant differences in efﬁcacy or safety outcomes\\nbetween dabigatran and enoxaparin [63].\\n# 7. Conclusions\\nPatients undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery\\nreceive thromboprophylaxis because of their increased risk\\nof developing VTE. With the overall aging of the population,\\nmore patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are likely\\nto be receiving anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolic\\ndisorders prior to their surgical procedure. Several direct\\nOACs are currently approved for different therapeutic indica-\\ntions, including prevention of VTE after elective knee or hip\\nreplacement surgery, and their use in clinical practice has been\\ngrowing. Effective management of these direct OACs and\\nregional anesthesia is essential to avoid bleeding complica-\\ntions and is, therefore, a topic of crucial interest for anesthesi-\\nologists. Thromboprophylaxis with all direct OACs may start\\nbetween 1 and 24 hours after surgery [6,8,10], provided that\\nhemostasis has been achieved, and thus should present a lower\\ntheoretical risk of bleeding or neuraxial hematoma in case of\\ncentral blocks, in comparison with preoperatively initiated\\nLMWH. After surgery, restarting direct OACs can be delayed\\nby up to 48 hours in cases of bleeding or a difﬁcult neuraxial\\nblock, and protection against thromboembolic events is\\nachieved within hours after the ﬁrst dose of these agents and\\nwithout the need for bridging therapy. The effect of the type\\nof anesthesia on clinical outcomes of the direct OACs is still\\nunclear. Subanalyses of RE-MODEL, RE-NOVATE, and\\nRE-MOBILIZE data suggest that, irrespective of the anesthe-\\nsia used, neuraxial anesthesia was associated with a lower risk'),\n",

A growing body of clinical study and\\nreal-world data, particularly with rivaroxaban, suggests that\\nneuraxial anesthesia can be undertaken in patients undergoing\\nmajor orthopedic surgery without increasing the risk of\\ncompressive hematoma, provided that guideline recommenda-\\ntions are followed and bleeding risk is evaluated on an individ-\\nual basis.\\n# Acknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Li Wan for\\neditorial support, with funding from Bayer HealthCare\\nPharmaceuticals and Janssen Scientiﬁc Affairs, LLC.\\n# References\\n- [1] Deitelzweig SB, Johnson BH, Lin J, Schulman KL.

Introduction\\nCardiac surgery carries a high risk of peri-operative bleeding [1], as\\nevidenced by the high proportion (50–60%) of cardiac surgical patients\\nwho require allogeneic blood transfusion during and after surgery [2,3].\\nThe risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery is affected by numerous factors:\\ninvasiveness of the procedure; use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet\\nmedication; use of hypothermia; and use of cardiopulmonary bypass\\n(CPB) [1]. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of\\nbleeding such as advanced age, poor platelet function, preoperative\\nanaemia, small body size, female sex, non-elective surgery, and repeat\\nsurgery [1].\\nPeri-operative bleeding has been shown to be an independent pre-\\ndictor of hospital mortality. In a study including more than 9000 pa-\\ntients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, massive blood loss (defined\\nby the transfusion of at least five units of packed red blood cells on the\\nday of surgery) was associated with an 8-fold increase in mortality [4].\\nOther studies have also reported excess morbidity, particularly in terms\\nof thromboembolic complications, infections and higher rates of surgical\\nre-exploration [5]. Notably, surgical re-exploration and transfusion\\nfollowing bleeding are also associated with increased infection, mor-\\ntality, and a longer stay in ICU and hospital [2,6]. Finally, excessive\\npostoperative haemorrhage in cardiac surgery has a significant eco-\\nnomic impact: a retrospective German analysis of more than 1100 pa-\\ntients estimated its average additional cost to be €6251 per patient [7].\\nThe concept of patient blood management (PBM), defined by the\\nWorld Health Organization as a “patient-focused, evidence based and\\nsystematic approach for optimising the management of patients and\\ntransfusion of blood products to ensure high quality and effective patient\\ncare” [8] includes an anaesthetic, pharmacological and surgical\\napproach. It is based on three pillars: optimization of blood mass,\\nminimization of blood loss and optimization of patient tolerance to\\nanaemia. In cardiac surgery, the use of antifibrinolytics is an essential\\ncomponent of the pharmacological approach in PBM and follows rec-\\nommendations from the European Association for Cardiothoracic Sur-\\ngery (EACTS) and the European Association of Cardiothoracic\\nAnaesthesiology (EACTA) [1].\\nThis review provides an overview of the major role of fibrinolysis in\\nhaemostatic disorders after cardiac surgery and how it influences their\\nmanagement, compares the current available guidelines in PBM and\\nanalyses the place of different antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery in\\nEurope, according to these guidelines.\\n2. Fibrinolysis and heart surgery – antifibrinolytic treatments\\n2.1. Haemostatic disorders induced by cardiac surgery\\nCPB used during cardiac surgery leads to activation of the coagula-\\ntion system due to blood coming into contact with foreign surfaces such\\nas plastic [9,10]. Thus, by the end of CPB, a significant proportion of\\ncoagulation factors will have been consumed; fibrinogen levels are\\ndecreased by approximately 40% [9] and platelets are activated,\\nconsumed and show a selective loss of alpha granules. In contrast,\\nthrombin levels are elevated, which is not the case in other types of\\nsurgery [10]. Along with activating the generation of fibrin, thrombin is\\nalso an activator of fibrinolysis.\\nGenerally, fibrinolysis is a protective physiological response, pro-\\nportionately inhibiting excess clot formation. However, after massive\\ntrauma, surgery, or with the use of CPB, local regulation of this response\\nmay be overwhelmed, so that the systemic and simultaneous production\\nof thrombin and plasmin induces consumption coagulopathy, which\\nprevents the formation of a stable clot, resulting in bleeding [11,12].\\nFibrinolysis is also associated with impaired platelet function during and\\nafter CPB due to the action of plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator\\n(tPA) [11]. tPA is responsible for inhibition of platelet aggregation, and\\nhigh plasmin levels can cause damage to platelets through cleavage of\\nthe GPIb receptor and triggering their partial activation, thus inducing a\\nloss of responsiveness to further activation [13,14] (Fig. 1). Thus,\\nfibrinolysis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of haemorrhage\\nduring cardiac surgery, as evidenced by the strong correlation of fibri-\\nnolytic markers and the magnitude of blood loss after CPB [9,15].\\n2.2. Antifibrinolytic treatment\\nAntifibrinolytic drugs inhibit fibrinolysis and, when administered\\nprophylactically, help prevent peri-operative bleeding [16,17].\\nCommonly used antifibrinolytics include protease inhibitors (aprotinin)\\nand lysine analogues (tranexamic acid (TXA) and ε-aminocaproic acid\\n(EACA)).\\nAprotinin is a potent inhibitor of free plasmin which has a limited\\neffect on physiological fibrinolysis [9,18]. Aprotinin is a broad-spectrum\\nprotease inhibitor, which also interacts with various other plasma pro-\\nteases such as trypsin, kallikrein and elastase. Among the anti-\\nfibrinolytics, it has the most potent activity [1,12]. It also has an anti-\\ninflammatory effect decreasing systemic inflammation after CPB [19].\\nLysine analogues are currently the most widely used anti-\\nfibrinolytics. These synthetic derivatives of lysine inhibit fibrinolysis by\\npreventing the formation of plasmin through their capacity to bind to\\nplasminogen at the lysine binding site, thus preventing its binding to\\nfibrin [11,18] (Fig. 2).\\nThe prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytics in surgery has\\nbeen widely researched and discussed. Antifibrinolytics reduce peri and\\npost-operative bleeding, transfusions, re-operations as well as\\nmorbidity, mortality, and associated costs, without increasing the inci-\\ndence of acute graft thrombosis or thromboembolism [20]. Data suggest\\nthat aprotinin has an advantage over lysine analogues in reducing peri-\\nand post-operative blood loss [21]. When trial results for the two lysine\\nanalogues were combined and compared with aprotinin alone, aprotinin\\nwas found to be slightly more effective in reducing the need for red\\nblood cell transfusion. The data from 150 trials performed in cardiac\\nsurgery in more than 17,000 patients are consistent with these results\\n[21] (Table 1).\\nIn 2008, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market following the\\npublication of observational studies that reported an increased risk of\\nadverse cardiological, neurological and renal events [9,22], as well as\\nthe preliminary results from a comparative, randomized, double-blind\\nstudy (the BART trial), which raised suspicion of excess mortality\\nlinked to aprotinin [23]. However, thereafter, numerous methodological\\nflaws were found in these analyses that could have influenced their re-\\nsults. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of data from 88 trials including over\\n15,000 patients found no increased risk of mortality associated with\\naprotinin compared with other antifibrinolytics [24]. In 2012, after re-\\nevaluation of the data, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\\nconcluded that: “the data from the BART study concerning excess\\nmortality associated with aprotinin were not reliable” and lifted the\\nsuspension of aprotinin's marketing authorization, but restricted its\\nindication to the prophylactic use in adult patients at high risk of major\\nbleeding undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) sur-\\ngery [25].\\nFor the lysine analogues, attention has recently been drawn to the\\npossible but rare occurrence of epileptic seizures [9]. A large retro-\\nspective study of over 11,000 patients undergoing CPB reported an\\nincidence of seizures of 0.9% in those treated with TXA. Patients with\\nepileptic seizures had a 2.5 to 3-fold higher death rate, and hospital stay\\nwas twice as long. The administration of TXA has been shown to be an\\nindependent predictor of seizures, correlated with higher doses [26,27].\\n3.

Methodology for the overview of PBM guidelines in Europe\\nA literature search was performed in December 2020 and repeated in\\nJanuary 2021 using PubMed, Cochrane Database and Google Scholar\\ndatabases. Twelve documents were identified containing or related to\\nPBM guidelines. Of these 13 articles, 8 were actual PBM guidelines\\n(Table 2).\\n# 3.2. European guidelines\\nThe European Commission promotes the implementation of PBM\\nprograms, by supporting the “Optimal Blood Use Project” which led to\\nthe creation of a website and to publication in 2016 of the “Manual of\\nOptimal Blood Use” [28]. The use of antifibrinolytics is mentioned to\\navoid the need for transfusion during elective surgery, notably TXA for\\npatients with high risk of bleeding. The following year, the European\\nCommission published a guide for building national PBM programs for\\nhealth authorities and for hospitals inside the EU [29,30]. This guide\\ndefines the basics of PBM, presents some successful non-European PBM\\ninitiatives and identifies current gaps and limiting factors in the\\nimplementation of PBM at a large scale (lack of PBM awareness, lack of\\nundergraduate education on PBM and transfusion in nursing and med-\\nical schools, lack of coordinated patient care, etc.). This guide is to be\\nused as a tool setting the framework for national authorities to support\\nthe implementation and dissemination of PBM programs across Europe.\\nAt the European level, an update of the “Management of severe\\nperioperative bleeding” guidelines was published in 2017 by the ESAIC\\n[31]. These general PBM recommendations are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery; nevertheless, the management of cardiac surgical patients is\\ndiscussed. The recommendations are classified according to the GRADE\\n(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-\\ntion) system. In cardiovascular surgery, the authors recommend the\\nprophylactic administration of TXA before CPB in patients undergoing\\nCABG (level of evidence (LoE) 1A). Besides, topical application of TXA\\nto the chest cavity in order to reduce blood loss following cardiac sur-\\ngery is also suggested (LoE 2C). Aprotinin is mentioned throughout the\\ndocument, with comparison of the efficacy data from several clinical\\ntrials. No detailed protocol or dosing regimens for the use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics (either TXA or aprotinin) is provided in these guidelines\\nand the indications for the use of aprotinin are not defined.\\nEuropean PBM guidelines specifically dedicated to cardiac surgery\\nwere published jointly in 2018 by the EACTS and the EACTA [1]. The\\nrecommendations are divided according to the three steps of the surgical\\nprocedure: preoperative management, intraoperative management, and\\npostoperative management. During the preoperative phase, the authors\\nsuggest a potential interest for point-of-care (POC) testing, which is\\nmeant to predict perioperative bleeding. Thus, a preoperative assess-\\nment of some specific haemostasis parameters has been proposed\\n(standard laboratory testing, viscoelastic testing and/or platelet func-\\ntion evaluation). The recommendations are as follow: 1/ preoperative\\nlevels of fibrinogen may be considered to identify patients at high-risk of\\nbleeding (Class IIb – level C), and 2/ platelet function testing may be\\nconsidered only in patients who recently received P2Y12 inhibitors or\\nwho have ongoing dual antiplatelet therapy, to guide the decision on the\\ntiming of cardiac surgery (Class IIb – Level B). In the perioperative\\nsetting, treatment algorithms based on viscoelastic POC tests should be\\nconsidered in order to reduce the number of transfusions for the\\nbleeding patient (Class IIa – Level B).\\nAntifibrinolytics (TXA, aprotinin or EACA) are recommended during\\nthe intraoperative period to reduce blood loss and the need for trans-\\nfusion, and also to reduce the risk of reoperation for bleeding (TXA and\\naprotinin) (level of evidence 1A). No therapeutic protocols or dosing\\nregimens for the use of antifibrinolytics are recommended. Finally, the\\nimplementation of a PBM protocol for bleeding patients is recommended\\n(LoE1C).\\n3.3. National guidelines\\n3.3.1. France\\nSpecific guidelines dedicated to PBM are currently not available in\\nFrance, however, a White Paper was published in 2018 [32] by several\\nlearned societies (French Society of Anaesthesia and Resuscitation;\\nStudy Group on Haemostasis and Thrombosis; French Society of\\nThoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery; French Society of Vigilance and\\nTherapeutics).\\nThis publication summarizes the principles of PBM with the three-\\npillars-based approach and presents a series of recommendations for\\nthe implementation of PBM in France. It includes an international\\nliterature review, a multidisciplinary field survey and recommendations\\nfrom the scientific committee to provide guidance on the implementa-\\ntion of PBM programs. The field survey demonstrated that PBM as a\\nformalized concept was not very well known by French practitioners.\\nRegarding the use of antifibrinolytics, the authors recommended TXA (1\\ng) at anaesthetic induction and at the end of the surgical procedure (1 g).\\nThe authors considered that the topical application of TXA needs further\\nresearch. It should serve as a basis for French guidelines on PBM, which\\nare expected soon by the Haute Autorit´e de Sant´e (HAS) [33].\\n3.3.2. Germany\\nIn 2020, cross-sectional guidelines on therapy with blood compo-\\nnents and plasma derivatives were published by the Executive board of\\nthe German Medical Association [34]. Cardiac surgery is mentioned\\nthroughout the document, but without any discussion on the potential\\nuse of antifibrinolytics. However, the use of TXA is recommended to\\nlimit blood loss in several types of surgical procedures and for the peri-\\nand postpartum period.\\n3.3.3. Italy\\nThe Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and\\nIntensive Care has written a position paper on the clinical standards for\\nPBM, and perioperative haemostasis and coagulation management in\\n2019 [35]. These recommendations are divided according to the three\\nsteps of any surgical procedure (pre-, peri- and postoperative period),\\neach one being subdivided according to the three pillars of PBM\\napproach. Cardiac surgery is discussed throughout the document. The\\nuse of antifibrinolytics is discussed in the “Pillar 2 – Blood containment”\\nsection of the chapter on perioperative management. No detailed\\nguidelines are provided, but prophylactic administration of TXA is rec-\\nommended before CPB in patients undergoing CABG, as advised in the\\nESAIC guidelines [31]. Finally, the authors mentioned that to decrease\\nthe risk of postoperative blood loss following cardiac surgery, TXA can\\nbe applied topically.\\n3.3.4. The Netherlands\\nGuidelines on blood transfusion have been published in 2011 by the\\nDutch Institute For Healthcare Improvement [36]. They are not dedi-\\ncated to PBM, which is not surprising as this concept was just emerging\\nat that time. However, these guidelines include “Blood saving tech-\\nniques and medications,” which covers the following points: techniques\\nto limit blood loss during surgical procedures; preoperative and peri-\\noperative autologous blood transfusion techniques; and combination of\\nblood saving techniques. Cardiac surgery and the use of antifibrinolytics\\nare discussed through the document. Aprotinin and TXA are mentioned.\\nHowever, at the time of publication, aprotinin had been withdrawn from\\nthe market, thus its use is not recommended. TXA is described as a safe\\nand effective drug to reduce blood loss and transfusion in cardiac sur-\\ngery (evidence Level 1A1).\\n3.3.5. Romania\\nThe Romanian Patient Blood Management Initiative Group pub-\\nlished national recommendations about perioperative PBM programme\\nin 2017 [37].

The United Kingdom\\nThe UK has several guidelines, each dealing with a particular aspect\\nof PBM. A short document entitled “Patient blood management – an\\nevidence-based approach to patient care,” published in 2014 by the\\nNational Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) and the NHS (National\\nHealth Service) [38] provides recommendations for the implementation\\nof PBM, but not specific to cardiac surgery. TXA is cited as a pharma-\\ncological drug to be used to reduce blood loss in intraoperative man-\\nagement, and in case of major bleeding. Nevertheless, no specific\\nprotocol on the use of TXA is proposed or discussed. The British Com-\\nmittee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) published two different\\nguidelines in 2015, under the GRADE rating system. The first covers the\\nidentification and management of preoperative anaemia [39], and the\\nsecond covers haematological management of major bleeding [40] and\\nprovides an overview of the organisational principles, transfusion of\\ndifferent blood products, pharmacological agents and addresses\\ndifferent specific situations. TXA and aprotinin are discussed, but only\\nthe use of TXA is recommended in case of major bleeding after injury, 1 g\\nintravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance administration of\\n1 g over 8 h (LoE1A). In non-traumatic major haemorrhage, the use of\\nTXA should be considered but not aprotinin (LoE1B). Regarding the\\nprevention of bleeding in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery,\\n(cid:0) 1)\\nthe authors recommended initial administration of TXA (10 mg.kg\\n(cid:0) 1.h (cid:0) 1\\nfollowed by 1 mg.kg\\nto prevent bleeding (LoE1B). Finally,\\nguidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and\\nIreland (AAGBI) were published in 2016, which address the use of blood\\nproducts and their alternatives [41]. They are not focused on cardiac\\nsurgery but devote a chapter specifically to it. PBM measures are rec-\\nommended in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, and TXA and\\naprotinin are mentioned. TXA is recommended to be used as a 1 g bolus,\\n(cid:0) 1\\nwith an additional infusion of 500 mg.h that could be considered.\\nAprotinin is recommended in case of myocardial revascularisation, as\\nlicensed.\\n4. Discussion\\nIn March 2011, the WHO held a “Global Forum on Blood Safety:\\nPatient Blood Management” aimed at establishing a framework for the\\nWHO Member States to actively support PBM dissemination and\\nimplementation [8]. Since then, PBM programs have been implemented\\nin many countries around the world. In 2021, the WHO published a new\\ndocument to highlight the urgent need to close the gap in PBM aware-\\nness and implementation and announced their upcoming initiative to\\ndevelop PBM implementation guidelines [42].\\nAt the European level, guidelines on bleeding management were\\npublished in 2017 by the ESAIC [31] and PBM guidelines specifically\\nfocussed on cardiac surgery were published in 2018 jointly by the\\nEACTS and the EACTA [1].\\nFurthermore, the implementation of PBM programs has been\\nactively supported by the European Commission, in particular through\\nguides intended for national health authorities and hospitals, meant to\\nhelp EU member states make PBM a standard for improving the quality\\nand safety of patient care. [29,30]\\nHowever, while PBM practices are increasingly being used, national\\nguidelines are still rare and very few are specific to cardiac surgery. All\\nthe current available guidelines follow and agree on the definition of\\nPBM as defined by the WHO [8], supported by three pillars: optimizing\\nblood volume, minimising blood loss and optimizing the patient's\\ntolerance to anaemia.\\nTo decrease blood loss during cardiac surgery, European guidelines\\nmention that the assessment of specific haemostasis parameters in the\\npreoperative setting (such as fibrinogen level and platelet function for\\nspecific patients…) could be useful to predict perioperative bleeding and\\nto decrease transfusion rates [1,43].\\nAnaemia is known to be a predictor of postoperative adverse out-\\ncomes for patients, so its management is the cornerstone of PBM.\\nLimiting blood loss during surgical procedures is also of paramount\\nimportance to reduce the use of blood products transfusions and limit\\nthe risk for reoperation for bleeding. In this context, the European and\\nnational PBM guidelines all recommend the prophylactic use of anti-\\nfibrinolytics to avoid or reduce perioperative bleeding. However, they\\ndiffer in the type of antifibrinolytic recommended, when it should be\\ngiven and how (bolus or infusion or both), including the dose (Table 3).\\nMost guidelines recommend only the use of tranexamic acid. Aprotinin\\nis rarely mentioned, partly because of its recent reintroduction in\\nEurope, and its continued non-availability on the market in some\\ncountries such as Italy. How Aprotinin should be given and when, as well\\nas the dose and timing of administration are mostly not discussed\\n(Table 4). National PBM guidelines for European countries therefore\\nappear to be both few in number and heterogeneous. This situation\\ncould partly explain the marked discrepancies found in a recent survey\\nof PBM practices in cardiac surgery across different European countries\\n[44]. In this survey, it appears that PBM programs are not universally or\\nconsistently implemented in European cardiac surgical centres, resulting\\nin differences in patient's management for the same clinical situation.\\nThe survey highlights that, the differences observed in guidelines,\\nincluding antifibrinolytic use, exist between countries at an interna-\\ntional level and also at a national level with different protocols in in-\\ndividual cardiac surgical centres within a specific country, and\\nsometimes, different protocols within the same cardiac surgical centre.\\nThe situation is quite different in the United States and in Australia,\\nwhere PBM practices are more widely implemented. The American So-\\nciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) published its “Practice guidelines for\\nperioperative blood management” in 2015 giving general recommen-\\ndations for PBM [45]. However, although the use of antifibrinolytic\\ntherapy is mentioned to reduce blood loss and risk of transfusion for\\npatient at high-risk of bleeding, or undergoing CPB, no detailed protocol\\nis provided. Furthermore, institutions such as the Society for the\\nAdvancement of Blood Management (SABM) and the American Associ-\\nation of Blood Banks (AABB)) actively promote the implementation of\\nPBM in the US by providing educational resources, partnerships and\\ncertification to hospitals.\\nAustralia appears to be one of the countries with the most compre-\\nhensive “supply” of PBM literature. The National Blood Authority (NBA)\\nadministers a website dedicated to PBM, including extensive PBM\\nguidelines (Critical bleeding/massive transfusion; Perioperative; Medi-\\ncal; Critical care; Obstetrics and maternity; and Neonatal and paediat-\\nrics). These PBM guidelines were published in 2012, and in 2019 a\\nsurvey assessed how blood transfusions and patient outcomes in cardiac\\nsurgery changed after the guidelines were published [46]. The authors\\ndemonstrated that, thanks to the implementation of PBM guidelines,\\nthere was a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions in\"),\n",

The NBA also provides a national PBM imple-\\nmentation strategy guide covering 2017–2021 (updated every 4 years),\\nas well as patient information documents. It defines the principle of PBM\\nand the objectives of the national strategy, including implementation of\\nnationally coordinated measures for PBM, decreasing discrepancies in\\nclinical practices, consolidating existing PBM programs, identifying gaps\\nin knowledge and patient care, and increasing awareness and under-\\nstanding of PBM.\\nAll in all, European countries could benefit from the experience\\ngained through these programs developed by other countries to\\nimprove, accelerate and deploy the implementation of PBM at a large\\nscale.\\n# 5. Conclusion\\nDespite the trend towards high-level PBM practices, currently very\\nfew European countries have national PBM guidelines and these\\nguidelines, taken as a whole, are heterogeneous in form and content.\\nAntifibrinolytics play a major role in cardiac surgery, where the risk of\\nperioperative bleeding is high and affects a majority of patients, by\\neffectively reducing bleeding, transfusions and re-operations, as well as\\ntheir associated morbidity and mortality. They represent an essential\\npart of the pharmacological arsenal of patient blood management.\\nHowever, the use of these drugs in cardiac surgery in Europe is not\\ncovered in sufficient detail by national recommendations. This lack of\\ncommon recommendations is partly due to the scarcity of available\\nrobust data. It would be of particular interest to set up comparative\\nclinical studies with the major antifibrinolytics to determine the best\\nprotocols and dosages to use in practice and thus to homogenize prac-\\ntice. To complement these trials, a network meta-analysis or a system-\\natic review of the evidence to date on antifibrinolytics in cardiac surgery\\nand their effects on major patients' outcomes might be useful to generate\\nimportant data to rely on for daily practices.\\nTo conclude, implementation of PBM programs in Europe is chal-\\nlenging, as there is a real need for homogenous guidance in PBM and the\\nuse of antifibrinolytics, especially in cardiac surgery.\\n# Financial support and sponsorship\\nThis work was supported by Nordic Pharma, for the institutional\\nsupport, and Public Health Expertise for the medical writing support.\\n# Declaration of Competing Interest\\nAK has received funding for research to his institution or honoraria\\nfrom Massimo, Fisher & Paykel, Pharmacosmos and Nordic Pharma.

Type 2 diabetes is most\\ncommonly encountered, and only a minority of surgical patients have been diagnosed with another type of\\ndiabetes. Patients with a specific type of diabetes can be particularly prone to perioperative glycaemic dysre-\\ngulation. In addition, certain type-related features and pitfalls should be taken into account in the operating\\ntheatre. In this narrative review, we discuss characteristics of types of diabetes other than type 2 diabetes\\nrelevant to the anaesthetist, based on available literature and data from our clinic.\\n1. Introduction\\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is often considered a single disease entity in\\nthe perioperative period. The majority of patients with DM have type 2\\nDM (T2DM); the prevalence of type 1 DM (T1DM) is estimated to be only\\n5–10% of all patients with DM [1,2]. An even smaller portion of the\\npopulation is diagnosed with a specific type of DM which is secondary\\nto, or associated with, another disease or the use of specific medications.\\nExamples of the latter are gestational DM (GDM), DM after pancreatitis,\\nor DM induced by glucocorticoid use.\\nThe pathophysiology of these different types of DM vary signifi-\\ncantly, and likewise do the patient characteristics and their expected\\nglucose control [3–12]. Recent evidence suggests that prior infection\\nwith SARS-CoV-2 may increase the risk of DM. [13–15] We have pre-\\nviously shown that treating surgical patients with T1DM and T2DM\\nduring the perioperative period according to the same protocol resulted\\nin a higher incidence of hyperglycaemia in patients with T1DM\\ncompared to patients with T2DM [3]. In a subsequent observational\\nstudy, patients with certain uncommon forms of DM, such as DM after\\npancreatitis, were particularly vulnerable to perioperative glucose dys-\\nregulation [16]. The association between poor perioperative glucose\\ncontrol and unfavourable outcome has been well-established in various\\nsurgical settings [17–20]. Similar correlations have been found between\\npreoperative haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which reflects long-term\\nglucose control, and postoperative outcome [21–23].\\nCurrently, most perioperative guidelines recommend preoperative\\nevaluation of all patients with DM, yet pay little attention to the type of\\nDM [24,25], while some even state that care for patients should be\\nirrespective of type of DM [26]. We here suggest a more individualised\\napproach based on the specific type of DM and give an overview of types\\nof DM other than T2DM, with a particular focus on clinical features\\nrelevant to physicians involved in their perioperative care.\\n2. Types of diabetes\\nAccording to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of\\nMedical Care in Diabetes” [27], DM may be categorised into one of the\\nfollowing groups:\\n- 1) Type 1 diabetes, characterised by (mostly autoimmune induced)\\n- insulin deficiency;\\n- 2) Type 2 diabetes, characterised by the presence of insulin resistance\\n- and varying degrees of insulin deficiency (accounts for 90–95% of\\n- diabetic cases). This type of DM and its perioperative considerations\\n- are subject of many excellent reviews [28–30] and is not the focus of\\n- this paper;\\n- 3) Gestational diabetes;\\n\\n# https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2022.111012'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'document_name': '1-s2.0-S0952818022003701-main.json', 'page': 2}, page_content='4) Other specific types, including monogenic forms of DM, drug- or\\nchemical-induced DM and DM secondary to disease of the exocrine\\npancreas or endocrinopathies. The latter two are categorised\\ntogether as type 3 diabetes, which includes many subtypes.\\nMany patients with DM do not easily fit into one single category due\\nto multiple contributing etiological factors. For instance, a patient may\\nbe diagnosed with post-transplant DM (PTDM) due to its onset being\\nshortly after renal transplantation and prescription of immune modu-\\nlating drugs. The same patient may already have had an undiscovered\\nimpaired glucose tolerance which would have later developed into\\nT2DM. Thus, the circumstances present at the time of diagnosis often\\ndetermines the type of DM. Furthermore, many forms of DM are clini-\\ncally heterogeneous and considerable overlap between various forms\\nexists, for example when a T1DM patient suffers from increasing insulin\\nresistance due to obesity.\\nPreviously published data from a prospectively recorded cohort of\\npatients who presented for surgery in our clinic showed that besides\\nT2DM, the most frequently encountered types of DM were T1DM (40.8\\nper 10,000 surgeries), pancreatic DM (19.3 per 10,000) and GDM (14.3\\nper 10,000 surgeries, mostly caesarian sections) [16]. None of the\\nremaining types of DM had an incidence >2.7 per 10,000 [16]. The\\ndifferent types of DM, including their pathophysiology and\\nTable 1\\nTypes of diabetes and specific concerns for the anaesthetist.\\ncharacteristics relevant in the perioperative setting, have been sum-\\nmarised in Table 1.\\n2.1. Type 1 diabetes\\nImmune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic\\nβ-cells results in absolute insulin deficiency [31]. T1DM typically gets\\ndiagnosed during childhood or adolescence but can present at any age.\\nAbsolute insulin deficiency makes patients with T1DM dependent on\\nexogenous insulin and prone to developing ketoacidosis (Fig. 1) [32].\\nBasal insulin should therefore never be omitted perioperatively – that is,\\nketogenesis should be suppressed either by continuous infusion of short-\\nacting insulin or continuation of long-acting insulin. Most perioperative\\nDM guidelines recommend continuing the regular evening dose of long-\\nacting insulin on the day before surgery, irrespective of the type of DM.\\n[24,25,33,34] However, in patients with recurrent episodes of hypo-\\nglycaemia or in those scheduled for surgery in the afternoon, we\\nrecommend decreasing the evening dose by 25–50%. [35]\\nWhile insulin is vitally important in T1DM, it carries an inherent risk\\nof causing hypoglycaemia. The overall risk of hypoglycaemia is esti-\\nmated to be three times higher in T1DM compared to insulin-treated\\nT2DM [36]. This also appears to be true in the perioperative setting,\\nwhere the incidence of hypoglycaemia was 7.1% in T1DM compared to\\n| Type of diabetes | Pathophysiology and clinical features | Insulin deficiencya | Prone to glycaemic dysregulationb | Other perioperative concerns |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| T1DMc | (Immune-mediated) destruction of pancreatic β-cells, typically leading to absolute insulin deficiency. | Absolute | Yes | - Hypoglycaemia is common - Poor preoperative glucose control is common, refer to DM care physician if needed - Do not omit basal insulin, especially if anti- GADi titre is high - Few data regarding perioperative glucose control (cid:0) 1 - Recommended target range: 3.9–8.0 mmol.l (cid:0) 1) (70–144 mg.dl (cid:0) 1) may (cid:0) 1 (≥144 mg.dl - Glucose ≥8.0 mmol.l cause neonatal hypoglycaemia - Measure glucose in every woman undergoing caesarean section - Clinically heterogeneous - MODY subtype 2 (15–50%, Table 2) is generally mild; treat the remaining subtypes as T1DM/T2DM - No data regarding perioperative management - Marked glycaemic lability and unpredictable response to insulin administration may be present - Insulin administration during surgery may often be necessary, especially during pheochromocytoma surgery - Rebound hypoglycaemia after pheochromocytoma excision occurs frequently within the first 6 h after surgery |\\n| LADAd | Auto-immune diabetes which does not manifest until adulthood.

Hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk\\nof cardiovascular events and mortality [37,38]. Hypoglycaemia during\\nsurgery may be particularly severe and prolonged, since masking of\\nassociated symptoms, such as tachycardia and an altered state of con-\\nsciousness, by anaesthesia may cause it to remain unrecognised [39].\\nIn comparison with T2DM, perioperative hyperglycaemia has also\\nbeen found to be more common in T1DM [3,16]. Likewise, HbA1c\\nvalues are relatively high among T1DM patients undergoing surgery,\\nreflecting the more challenging long term glucose regulation in T1DM\\n[16,40]. The anaesthetist should therefore pay specific attention to\\nglucose control in patients with T1DM during pre-operative screening.\\nPatients with poorly regulated T1DM should be referred to their primary\\ndiabetes care physician to optimise the DM treatment regimen, espe-\\n(cid:0) 1\\ncially if their HbA1c exceeds 69 mmol.mol (8.5%) [25,41]. Periop-\\nerative glucose management protocols designed specifically for T1DM\\nhave not yet been investigated. However, the increased risk of both\\nhypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in T1DM highlights the importance\\nof frequent monitoring of blood glucose values. In summary, the\\nanaesthetist should always ensure basal insulin levels are met and\\nremain vigilant for both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.\\n2.1.1. Insulin pumps and glucose monitors\\nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, more\\ncommonly referred to as insulin pumps, are increasingly used in the\\ntreatment of T1DM. These devices deliver basal insulin by continuous\\nsubcutaneous infusion of rapid-acting insulin, usually at variable pre-\\nprogrammed rates, depending on the time of day. Patients may also use\\nthe device to calculate and administer the dose of insulin required to\\ncover the additional need for insulin before food intake, based on their\\nestimation of the carbohydrate content of a meal and a preset insulin-to-\\ncarbohydrate ratio [42]. Besides the obvious benefits of avoiding mul-\\ntiple subcutaneous insulin injections throughout the day, CSII in com-\\nparison with intermittent insulin injections has been shown to decrease\\nHbA1c in T1DM [43].\\nMost perioperative DM guidelines recommend continuing CSII dur-\\ning minor or ambulatory procedures, provided that the patient is not\\nexpected to miss more than one meal and the anaesthesia team is\\nfamiliar with the device [24,33,41,44]. The programmed basal infusion\\nFig. 1. Pathophysiology and clinical featues\\nof diabetic ketoacidosis.\\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is characterised by the\\ntriad of ketosis, acidosis and insulin defi-\\nciency, mostly resulting in hyperglycaemia.\\nAbsolute or relative insulin deficiency,\\ntogether with an increased concentration of\\ncounterregulatory hormones such as\\nglucagon and catecholamines, leads to an\\nincreased breakdown of triglycerides into\\nglycerol and non-esterified free fatty acids\\n(FFAs). Glycerol is used as a substrate for\\ngluconeogenesis and FFAs are oxidised to\\nketone bodies in the liver. Low insulin also\\nimpairs the clearance of ketone bodies.\\nAccumulation of ketone bodies, together\\nwith elevated levels of other organic acids\\nsuch as D-lactate, may lead to acidosis.\\nHyperglycaemia is caused by a combination\\nof increased gluconeogenesis and glycogen-\\nolysis in the presence of insulin deficiency,\\nas well as impaired glucose utilization due to\\ninsulin resistance. Since glucose is an\\nosmotically active substance, hyper-\\nglycaemia may result in transmembrane\\nshifts of water from the intracellular to\\nextracellular space (causing dilutional\\nhyponatraemia) and osmotic diuresis\\n(causing hypovolaemia and dehydration).\\nrate should be retrieved from the device during preoperative screening.\\nSome guidelines suggest lowering the basal infusion rate of the CSII\\npump by 20–40% in the perioperative period [45], especially if the\\npatient experienced hypoglycaemic episodes [34], whereas others state\\nthe usual rate can be continued [26,44]. If CSII pumps are used in the\\noperating theatre, glucose values should be checked at least hourly, as\\ncatheter occlusion and pump failure can lead to ketoacidosis. Correction\\ndoses of insulin in case of hyperglycaemia should not be given via the\\nCSII pump.\\nUnfortunately, there are only few data on the use of CSII during\\nsurgery. In a retrospective analysis of 92 cases, no significant difference\\nin mean blood glucose was detected when comparing preoperative\\nconversion to intravenous insulin infusion with perioperative continu-\\nation of CSII [46]. No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic\\nketoacidosis were recorded in this sample. In another study, 49 patients\\nwho underwent elective ambulatory surgery were managed according to\\na perioperative CSII protocol [47]. The majority of patients (63%) had a\\n(cid:0) 1 (cid:0) 1) and no\\nfirst postoperative blood glucose ≤11.1 mmol.l (200 mg.dl\\nepisodes of hypoglycaemia were recorded.\\nIt is considered safer to switch to intravenous insulin infusion in\\npatients undergoing major surgery or long-lasting (> 2 h) procedures, as\\ncounterregulatory hormones may increase insulin requirements and\\nhaemodynamic fluctuations with decreased skin perfusion may theo-\\nretically cause unpredictable subcutaneous adsorption of insulin.\\nPerhaps even more importantly, the postoperative management of the\\nCSII pump can become problematic due to glycaemic dysregulation or\\nthe patient's inability to correctly operate the pump. Finally, the pump\\nshould be removed during radiological procedures such as CT, MRI and\\ncardiac catheterisation, and the pump should be placed away from the\\nelectrical arc when using (monopolar) electrocautery [42,48].\\nSome T1DM patients use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM),\\nwhich measures the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid\\nthrough a small subcutaneous needle at regular intervals (e.g. every 5\\nmin) [49]. Sensor accuracy may theoretically be influenced by episodes\\nof hypotension, hypothermia and hypoxia, all of which occur more or\\nless frequently in the perioperative period. Indeed, studies investigating\\nthe accuracy of subcutaneous CGM in critically ill patients have reported\\nlarge deviations from reference measurement in some devices [50]. Only\"),\n",

Certain drugs that are sometimes used in the perioperative\\nperiod may interfere with CGM readings, including acetaminophen,\\nmannitol, heparin and dopamine [49]. CGM readings should therefore\\nalways be confirmed using standard laboratory or certified point-of-care\\ntesting, prior to making treatment decisions with respect to insulin\\ntherapy. Removing a CGM is undesirable if not necessary, since not all\\ncomponents are disposable and can be costly to replace. Finally, it\\nshould be noted that most commercially available CSII and CGM devices\\nlack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for perioperative\\nuse.\\nMore recent developments include sensor-augmented pumps, which\\nintegrate CGM and CSII technology to suspend insulin infusion when\\nglucose levels reach a preset threshold value, as well as fully automated\\ninsulin delivery devices, known as a closed-loop system or ‘artificial\\npancreas’ [54,55]. In a large multicenter trial, a closed loop system\\nincreased the time spent within target range by 11% compared to\\nsensor-augmented pumps in patients with T1DM [54]. In case these\\npromising devices receive approval for intraoperative use by the regu-\\nlatory agencies in the future, it is important to ensure adequate knowl-\\nedge of closed-loop systems and the availability of immediate expert\\nconsultation, regular (i.e., every 1–2 h) calibration of the CGM to\\nreference glucose, positioning away from the surgical field without risk\\nof dislodgement, and switching to intravenous insulin infusion during\\nmajor surgery or during states of impaired tissue perfusion, hypothermia\\nand major dysglycaemia [55].\\n2.2. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)\\nLADA is a specific form of auto-immune DM, although the added\\nvalue of this diagnosis is debatable. Some epidemiological studies sug-\\ngest that LADA may account for as much as 4.5–9.7% of all adult-onset\\ncases of DM [56–58], due to the presence of islet-cell specific autoan-\\ntibodies which are diagnostic for LADA [4]. Contrary to T1DM, LADA\\ndoes not manifest itself until adulthood and does not require insulin\\ntherapy at the time of diagnosis [4]. Consequently, these patients\\ninitially share many clinical features with T2DM and may therefore be\\nmisdiagnosed. Since the respective autoantibodies are not routinely\\nassessed, LADA is most likely underdiagnosed. LADA is a heterogeneous\\nform of DM due to variable degrees of insulin insufficiency and resis-\\ntance [59].\\nThe titre of the most prominent autoantibody, anti-glutamic acid\\ndecarboxylase (GAD), seems to be correlated with the degree of\\nphenotypic similarity to T1DM – that is, a higher rate of insulin\\nrequirement, an increased risk for ketoacidosis and a relatively lower\\nbody mass index (BMI) [58,59]. Conversely, LADA with a low anti-GAD\\ntitre is clinically more similar to T2DM. Overall, compared to T2DM,\\npatients with LADA tend to show fewer signs of the metabolic syndrome\\nsuch as hypertension and dyslipidaemia [4]. Although disease progress\\nis slow in LADA compared to T1DM [4], it could impact perioperative\\nglucose control. Thus, the diagnosis should prompt the anaesthetist to\\nactively monitor blood glucose values and to never omit basal insulin in\\npatients with LADA in order to prevent ketoacidosis, especially if the\\nanti-GAD titre is high.\\n2.3. Gestational diabetes mellitus\\nDuring normal pregnancy, glucose uptake by the placenta lowers\\nfasting glycaemia. Later in pregnancy, diabetogenic placental hormones\\n(e.g. human placental lactogen and progesterone) result in postprandial\\nhyperglycaemia and increasing insulin resistance [5]. DM during preg-\\nnancy has become increasingly common. The global prevalence of\\nhyperglycaemia in pregnancy is estimated to be 16.9%, of which 84% is\\nGDM and the remainder is already known or previously undiagnosed\\nDM [60]. GDM is defined as DM first diagnosed during pregnancy that\\nwas not clearly overt DM prior to gestation [31]. However, it may not\\nalways be possible to fully exclude pre-existing DM. Insulin resistance\\nincreases exponentially during the second trimester together with body\\nweight, after which it levels off. GDM usually disappears soon after\\ndelivery, although both mother and child are at greater risk of devel-\\noping T2DM later in their lives [61].\\nIn general, DM during pregnancy is associated with an increased rate\\nof adverse outcomes, such as foetal structural defects [62], pre-\\neclampsia, shoulder dystocia and caesarean delivery [63]. During the\\npreoperative assessment of pregnant women, particular attention should\\nbe paid to glucose regulation and any glucose lowering agents used,\\nblood pressure trends and concomitant disease. Since GDM is of recent\\nonset by definition, the presence of end-organ damage in these women is\\nextremely unlikely.\\nAdequate glucose control during caesarean section is important,\\n(cid:0) 1 (cid:0) 1) during\\nsince a maternal blood glucose above 8 mmol.l (144 mg.dl\\nlabour is associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia [64,65]. The latter is\\ncaused by high foetal insulin levels induced by maternal hyper-\\nglycaemia, as glucose can freely pass through the placenta. In GDM\\nspecifically, the incidence of severe neonatal hypoglycaemia after de-\\nlivery is reported to be as high as 20% [66]. No guidelines exist\\nregarding the optimal glycaemic target in women with GDM presenting\\nfor surgery or caesarean section. However, a target range of 3.9–8.0\\n(cid:0) 1 (70–144 mg.dl 1) would be reasonable, since it incorporates\\n(cid:0)\\nmmol.l\\nthe recommendations of multiple guidelines regarding intrapartum\\nglycaemic management and precludes neonatal hypoglycaemia\\n[67–69]. After delivery, glucose lowering agents are discontinued in\\nwomen with GDM while monitoring blood glucose. Diagnostic criteria\\nfor GDM do not include HbA1c, although it may be used to exclude pre-\\nexisting DM [67]. Guidelines recommend an HbA1c target of ≤48 mmol.\\n(cid:0) 1\\nmol (6.5%) for DM during pregnancy in general, as the risk of\\ncongenital abnormalities increases above these plasma values [67,70].\\nIn general, the anaesthetist should not expect many difficulties with\\nglucose control in women with GDM. In a study from our centre, most\\nwomen with GDM who underwent surgery (mostly caesarean section)\\nwere relatively well controlled, although some did reach preoperative or\\npeak postoperative glucose levels associated with neonatal hypo-\\n(cid:0) 1 > 144 mg.dl 1) [40]. We therefore\\n(cid:0)\\nglycaemia (i.e. >8 mmol.l or\\nrecommend measuring blood glucose in every patient with GDM and to\\ncorrect elevated glucose levels using insulin injections, irrespective of\\nany previous use of glucose lowering medication. In addition, the\\ndiagnosis of GDM warrants assessment of related risks of foetal and\\nmaternal complications postpartum.\\n2.4. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)\\nSeveral rare types of DM are caused by monogenic defects in β-cell\\nfunction. MODY is the most common form of monogenic DM [32]. It is a\\ngroup of autosomal dominantly inherited disorders which classically\\npresent before the age of 25. Depending on the type of mutation, insulin\\nsecretion is variably impaired, whereas insulin action is mostly unaf-\\nfected. MODY2 and MODY3 are the most common subtypes, each ac-\\ncounting for 15–50% of all cases (Table 2) [6]. MODY2 is caused by\\nmutations in the gene encoding glucokinase, which plays a central role\\nas a glucose sensor in pancreatic β-cells [71]. Patients with MODY2 have\\nonly moderately elevated glucose concentrations, are generally asymp-\\ntomatic, do not require pharmacologic treatment and rarely develop\\nvascular complications [72]. Thus, it is unlikely that this subtype poses\\nany significant challenges for the anaesthetist, and glucose lowering\\ntreatment should be avoided. MODY3 causes progressive β-cell\\ndysfunction caused by a mutation in the HFN1A gene, resulting in\\nincreasing hyperglycaemia over time. Patients usually respond well to\\nsulfonylureas, but insulin is often necessary in the long run in later\\nstages [31]. Otherwise, no specific treatment for MODY exists. Contrary\\nto MODY2, the risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complica-\\ntions for MODY3 patients is comparable to T1DM and T2DM [73]. To'),\n",

Pancreatic diabetes\\nVarious pancreatic disorders may cause secondary DM, referred to as\\npancreatic or type 3c DM. The most common underlying cause is chronic\\npancreatitis, which is estimated to account for approximately three out\\nof four cases [74]. Deficiency of insulin production due to extensive\\nfibrosis and destruction of pancreatic islet tissue is the main mechanism\\nby which chronic pancreatitis leads to DM, although hepatic and pe-\\nripheral insulin resistance also play a significant role [75,76]. More than\\nhalf of the patients with DM secondary to chronic pancreatitis are\\ninsulin-dependent [77,78]. This proportion may even be higher in the\\nsurgical population: over 80% of patients with pancreatic DM in our\\nclinic were insulin-dependent [40]. Other pancreatic disorders that may\\ncause DM include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hemochromatosis, cystic\\nfibrosis (CF) and (post-)pancreatic surgery. Outside the surgical setting,\\npancreatic DM has been associated with poorer glucose control\\ncompared to T2DM [7]. Data from our centre show that perioperative\\nglucose control is also poor, considering that more than half of the pa-\\ntients with pancreatic diabetes in the recovery ward had a measured\\n(cid:0) 1 72–180 mg.\\nblood glucose above target range (i.e. 4–10 mmol.l or\\n(cid:0) 1) [16]. It is important to note that concomitant impairment of the\\ndl\\ncounterregulatory glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells may cause\\nmarked glycaemic lability and an unpredictable response to exogenous\\ninsulin administration [79,80]. It makes sense for the anaesthetist to\\nconsider this a type-1-like form of DM requiring meticulous insulin\\ndosing and frequent assessment of glucose values.\\n2.5.1. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD)\\nCF is caused by absence or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane\\nconductance regulator, a chloride channel which is normally present in\\nthe apical membranes of various epithelial cells, giving rise to thick,\\nviscous secretions in multiple organs including the pancreas [8]. CFRD is\\npresent in 40–50% of adults diagnosed with CF [81]. The primary defect\\nis severe insulin deficiency due to a reduction of β-cell mass [8]. Unlike\\nT1DM, some residual insulin secretion is still present, making CFRD\\npatients less prone to develop ketoacidosis. In our clinic, most CFRD\\npatients were younger than 40 years old [16], reflecting the early onset\\nof CFRD and the decreased life expectancy of these patients [81]. One\\nthird of these patients was treated with a continuous insulin pump. With\\na single exception that may be explained by corticosteroid administra-\\ntion, the CRFD patients remained within glycaemic target range.\\n2.6. Diabetes secondary to endocrinopathies\\nThere is a number of endocrinopathies that may cause DM due to the\\nexcess release of counterregulatory hormones. Among these are growth\\nhormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in acromegaly,\\ncortisol in hypercortisolism, and catecholamines in pheochromocytoma.\\nPatients with these types of DM are not frequently encountered in the\\noperating theatre–about 1 in every 10,000 surgical cases for each of the\\naforementioned endocrinopathies [16].\\n2.6.1. Acromegaly\\nAcromegaly is usually caused by a GH-secreting pituitary tumour.\\nDM is a common complication seen in over one third of all patients [82].\\nHbA1c values reported in patients with acromegaly are highly variable,\\n(cid:0) 1 (5.9–7.0%)\\nwith mean values ranging from 41 to 53 mmol.mol\\n[83,84]. GH is an anabolic hormone which affects glucose metabolism\\nvia various pathways, both directly and indirectly through IGF-1 stim-\\nulation. Excess secretion may lead to hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance\\nand eventually β-cell dysfunction [9,85]. Treatment options for acro-\\nmegaly include transsphenoidal surgery, radiotherapy and somatostatin\\nanalogues. However, although these often improve glucose metabolism,\\nDM may still persist after surgery if β-cell dysfunction is already present\\n[86,87]. Although the disease duration is typically <10 years [86], some\\npatients in our clinic were particularly insulin-resistant based on their\\ndaily dose of insulin and intraoperative insulin requirements [16].\\nConcomitant dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\\nmay further complicate glucose control.\\n2.6.2. Hypercortisolism\\nThe most common cause of endogenous hypercortisolism is Cushing's\\ndisease (CD), which is caused by uncontrolled release of adrenocorti-\\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) from a pituitary adenoma. The prevalence of\\nDM in CD is reported to be 20–45% [10]. Chronically elevated levels of\\nglucocorticoids lead to reduced peripheral and hepatic insulin sensi-\\ntivity [88], abnormal pancreatic insulin secretion and changes in adi-\\npose tissue biology [10]. Cortisol predominantly affects postprandial\\nglucose levels, which may cause fasting glucose levels to remain normal\\n[10]. Resection of the pituitary adenoma is the first-line treatment of CD\\nwith a remission rate between 65% and 90% [89], although insulin\\nresistance may still persist afterwards [90]. Glucose should be measured\\nat least once every two hours during surgery and insulin should be\\nadministered timely, especially in cases with poor preoperative glucose\\ncontrol.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'document_name': '1-s2.0-S0952818022003701-main.json', 'page': 6}, page_content='# 2.6.3. Pheochromocytoma\\nEpisodes of hyperglycaemia are common in pheochromocytoma, due\\nto direct suppression of pancreatic insulin release and stimulation of\\nglucagon release by catecholamines [91]. It has been suggested that\\nimpairment of insulin secretion is the primary mechanism by which\\npheochromocytoma causes DM [92], although insulin resistance may\\nalso play a role [93]. Hypoglycaemia due to excessive rebound secretion\\nof insulin after pheochromocytoma excision is a frequent complication\\nafter endocrine surgery, and is usually seen 1 to 6 h after surgery\\n[94,95]. It would be reasonable to monitor patients who underwent\\npheochromocytoma excision during the first 6 h after surgery at a post\\nanaesthesia care unit for hourly glucose measurement and, if necessary,\\nglucose administration.\\n2.7. Drug- or chemical-induced diabetes\\nVarious drugs or chemicals have the potential to precipitate DM, e.g.\\nby destroying pancreatic β-cells, impairing insulin action or inducing\\nislet cell antibodies. Chronic systemic glucocorticoid treatment can lead\\nto DM through mechanisms comparable to endogenous hypercortisolism\\n[88]. Patients being treated with systemic glucocorticoids develop DM\\nin 18.6% of cases [11]. Preoperative fasting glucose is generally low in\\nthese patients, as glucocorticoids preferentially affect postprandial\\nglucose levels [96]. However, postoperative peak glucose can be\\nsignificantly increased [16], reflecting insulin resistance caused by a\\ncombination of surgical stress and corticosteroid “stress dose”\\nadministration.\\n# 2.8. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus\\nPost-transplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) has largely replaced the\\nterm New-Onset Diabetes After Transplantation (NODAT), since the\\nlatter implies exclusion of pre-existing DM which may not always be the\\ncase [97]. More than three out of four cases of PTDM occur within the\\nfirst three months after transplantation [98]. The cumulative incidence\\nof PTDM depends on the transplanted organ, and is estimated to be [98]:\\n- - 10–20% after kidney transplantation;\\n- - 20–30% after heart transplantation;\\n- - 20–40% after lung transplantation;\\n- - 30–40% after liver transplantation.\\n\\nPTDM is listed as a drug-induced form of DM, because the immu-\\nnosuppressive agents used after transplantation are a major contributor\\nto the development of PTDM [31,97–99] (Table 3). Calcineurin in-\\nhibitors are known to considerably impair insulin secretion, tacrolimus\\nmore so than cyclosporin A [100]. Other possible contributing factors\\ninclude increased insulin degradation by the transplant kidney, physical\\ninactivity after transplantation, as well as the β-cell toxic effect of the\\nresulting hyperglycaemia itself [99].\\nPatients with PTDM and hyperglycaemia have an increased risk of\\ntransplant rejection, infection and hospitalisation [101]. Therefore, it is\\ncrucial to avoid perioperative hyperglycaemia. In addition, renal\\ntransplant recipients may have a high rate of hypoglycaemia due to the\\ninfluence of reduced and fluctuating renal function on glucose lowering\\nagents, in particular sulfonylureas [12,102]. This should also be taken\\ninto account in the perioperative setting.\\n3. Conclusion\\nPerioperative management of types of DM other than T2DM is un-\\nderappreciated in the literature and guidelines. Although some general\\nprinciples apply to all patients with DM, many forms of DM carry their\\nown characteristic features. Understanding these features will help cli-\\nnicians provide optimal perioperative diabetes care and prevent\\ncomplications.\\nTable 3\\nImmunosuppressive agents and their contribution to the development of Post-\\nTransplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) [98].\\n| Group | Main mechanisms |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Glucocorticoids | Induction of peripheral insulin resistance, thereby reducing glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle cells Induction of hepatic insulin resistance, increasing the hepatic glucose production |\\n| Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin A, tacrolimus) | Reduction of insulin release and β-cell proliferation by inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT* signal to the β-cell nucleus |\\n| † mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, everolimus) | Induction of free fatty acids release and lipotoxicity, thereby downregulating gene expression for insulin release and β-cell proliferation Reduction of insulin signaling by suppressing insulin-stimulated protein kinase B phosphorylation in liver, fat and muscle cells. |\\n| Other immunosuppressive agents (e.g. mycophenolate acid, betalacept) | Probably do not predispose to PTDM |\\n\\n- *\\n- Nuclear factor of activated T cells.\\n- †\\n- mechanistic target of rapamycin.\\n\\nFunding\\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding\\nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\\nDisclosures\\nThis work was supported and funded by the Department of Anes-\\nthesiology, Amsterdam UMC location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1100 AZ\\nAmsterdam.\\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\\nThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal re-\\nlationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:\\nRobert van Wilpe reports a relationship with European Society of\\nAnaesthesiology that includes: funding grants.

Introduction\\nThe uncontrolled use of fractional inspired oxygen during urgent\\ncare was once widespread [1]. The lack of precise monitoring equipment\\nforced anesthesia providers in the recent past to generously provide\\ntheir patients with oxygen. The paradigm was that an overload of oxy-\\ngen was not harmful or at least less harmful. Currently, more is known\\nabout the advantages and disadvantages of oxygen [2–5].\\nIn modern perioperative care, high levels of oxygen are still used\\nduring preoxygenation to minimize the risk of hypoxia during airway\\nmanagement [6]. There is also weak evidence that perioperative\\nhyperoxygenation can protect patients against postoperative nausea and\\nvomiting (PONV) [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested\\nin 2018 to administer a FiO2 of 80% to prevent surgical site infections\\n(SSIs). This suggestion concerns perioperative care for adults and has\\nbeen challenged. No suggestions were made for pediatric care [8].\\nHowever, oxygen can have a direct toxic effect. Reactive oxygen\\nspecies (ROS) can be generated during oxygen processing at the cellular\\nlevel. They have a small positive role in the immune system but have\\nmostly a negative contribution to human tissues [9]. First, they can lead\\nto DNA damage via oxidation of cell structures. Second, protein function\\ncan be affected. Third, they will damage pulmonary tissue which can\\nlead to acute lung injury [10,11]. These effects are particularly seen in\\nneonates [12]. Besides these direct toxic effects, oxygen has systemic\\neffects as well. It can lead to absorption atelectasis and systemic vaso-\\nconstriction, it influences hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, ROS\\ncould influence myocardial function after myocardial infarction, and\\noxygen could reduce cerebral blood flow [2,13].\\nIn intensive care and emergency settings protocols have been\\nimplemented to limit the use of oxygen, for example, during trauma care\\nand resuscitation care [14,15]. Especially in premature infants, a well-\\ndefined range of SpO2 targets is recommended to reduce the detri-\\nmental effects of oxygen, with a particular emphasis on preventing the\\nonset of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary\\ndysplasia (BPD) [10,16–18]. This is a goal-directed strategy of oxygen\\nadministration, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been sub-\\nject of research in pediatric anesthesia. Besides, no formal recommen-\\ndations exist for oxygen use during pediatric anesthesia. The Safetots\\ninitiative promotes the safe conduct of anesthesia to every child, which\\nincludes the suggestion to maintain normoxemia [19]. Pediatric anes-\\nthesiologists may therefore find themselves in a dilemma. On the one\\nhand, they are familiar with the above mentioned negative effects of\\noxygen. On the other hand, due to higher oxygen demand in children,\\ncombined with a lower functional residual capacity of the lungs, desa-\\nturation and hypoxemia may occur more easily during pediatric\\nanesthesia.\\nIn adult patients, oxygen management during anesthesia was\\ninvestigated earlier [20]. Because data of oxygen management in pedi-\\natric anesthesia are scarce, the goal of this study is to investigate the\\nintraoperative administration of oxygen and the incidence of hyper-\\noxemia in our current practice.\\n2. Materials and methods\\n# 2.1. Ethical approval\\nThis single-center retrospective observational study was conducted\\nat Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital. This study was conducted in\\naccordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (version\\n2013). The Research Ethics Board (Medical Ethics Committee (MEC),\\nErasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) approved this study on\\nMarch 5, 2020, with a waiver for the requirement for written informed\\nconsent (MEC number: MEC-2020-0121). All data retrieved from the\\nelectronic hospital record (EHR) were anonymized and captured in a\\ndatabase.\\nAll consecutive patients aged between 0 and 18 years were included.\\nThey had to undergo a diagnostic or surgical procedure under general\\nanesthesia between June 2017 and August 2020, with tracheal intuba-\\ntion and mechanical ventilation, as well as the insertion of an arterial\\ncatheter for regular arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling as determined by\\nthe attending anesthesiologist. ABGs were analyzed using a Radiometer\\nABL800 FLEX analyzer (Radiometer Medical ApS, Brønshøj, Denmark).\\nThese analyses were done at the discretion of the attending anesthesi-\\nologist. The staff of pediatric anesthesiologists consists of 20 consultants.\\nIn case of cardiopulmonary bypass, including extracorporeal mem-\\nbrane oxygenation (ECMO), and/or in the presence of a mixed circula-\\ntion, the patient was excluded. To be sure not to include a patient with a\\nmixed circulation, each case with an arterial oxygen saturation below\\n90% recorded at the time an ABG was taken, was individually reviewed\\nto ensure that it met the inclusion criteria. In case of missing data\\n(mainly if no blood was drawn or due to technical errors), the patient\\nwas also excluded.\\nAll data were retrieved from HiX (ChipSoft BV, Amsterdam, The\\nNetherlands), an EHR introduced at Erasmus MC Sophia Children's\\nHospital in June 2017. Individual cases were selected according to the\\nadministrative code for arterial catheter placement. The obtained data\\ncontained information on oxygenation values, patient characteristics,\\nABG values and type of surgery.\\n2.3. Study design\\nThe primary endpoint was to describe intraoperative FiO2 use, PaO2,\\nSpO2 and SaO2 values and the associated PaO2/FiO2 ratios (P/F ratios),\\nwhich is the ratio of PaO2 to FiO2. The secondary endpoints included the\\nassociation between patient characteristics and surgical parameters on\\nthis endpoint. The physiological status of the patient, according to the\\nASA Physical Status Classification System, the type of surgery (elective\\nor emergency/urgent surgery) and age group according to the Dutch\\nGuidelines for Pediatric Anesthesia [21] were evaluated. These groups\\nare as follows: group 1 consists of neonates and (ex-) prematures till 60\\nweeks postconceptional age; group 2 contains patients four weeks till\\none year old; group 3 includes patients one and two years old and group\\n4 contains patients three years and older.\\nCurrently there is no clear definition of hyperoxemia, and cut-off\\nvalues are a matter of debate. [3,5] As normoxemia could be defined\\nas PaO2 7 to 13.3 kPa (50 to 100 mmHg), the authors have chosen\\npragmatically to define the values below and above these physiological\\nrange as hypoxemia and hyperoxemia, respectively. [22–24] Therefore,\\nhyperoxemia was defined as values above a cut-off point of 13.3 kPa\\n(equivalent to 100 mmHg) and severe hyperoxemia as values above a\\ncut-off of 26.6 kPa (equivalent to 200 mmHg).\\n2.4. Statistical analysis\\nDescriptive analyses were used to evaluate the main endpoints of\\nFiO2 use and the corresponding P/F ratios. Data were examined for\\nnormality by visual aspects of the histograms and Q-Q plots as well as by\\nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In case of a skewed distribution,\\ndata were described with median and interquartile range (IQR).\\nThe correlation between FiO2 and PaO2 was determined using the\\nweighted Spearman correlation coefficient to correct for repeated\\nmeasurements using package ‘wCorr’ 22, 23 [25,26]. Since cases had\\nunequal amounts of observations, the number of observations were used\\nas weights.\\nDifferences in P/F ratios between groups of patients were tested\\nusing either the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. For the\\nKruskal-Wallis tests, in case a significant outcome occurred, post-hoc\\nanalysis was performed using the Dunn test with a Bonferroni\\ncorrection.\"),\n",

The P/F ratio decreased with increasing ASA classification\\nscores, as shown in Fig. 4 (p < 0.001).\\nPatients who underwent elective surgery had higher median P/F\\nratios than those who underwent emergency/urgent surgery (p <\\n0.001), 70.5 kPa (IQR 63.3 to 76.2); 529 mmHg (IQR 475 to 572) versus\\n36.8 kPa (IQR 20.9 to 70.0); 276 mmHg (IQR 157 to 525), respectively.\\nFurthermore, a significant difference in P/F ratios was found among\\nthe various age categories, as shown in Fig. 5 (p < 0.001). Neonates and\\n(ex-) prematures had significantly lower P/F ratios than all other age\\ngroups (p < 0.001). In age category I (n = 14) the specific oxygenation\\nvariables were as follows: FiO2 37% [IQR 24 to 48], SpO2 97% [IQR 95\\nto 99], PaO2 10.5 kPa [IQR 8.7 to 13.6]; 79 mmHg [65 to 102] and SaO2\\n96% [IQR 95 to 99].\\n# 4. Discussion\\nOur results showed hyperoxemia during neonatal and pediatric\\nanesthesia in almost all analyzed cases. Severe hyperoxemia was\\ndetected in 46% of unique diagnostic or surgical procedures. Median\\nFiO2 administration was 36% and median PaO2 was 23.6 kPa; 177\\nmmHg intraoperatively.\\nThese results suggest that progress can be made in further titrating\\nthe inspired fraction of oxygen perioperatively. There is growing evi-\\ndence of the negative effects of oxygen in the perioperative period\\n[13,27]. Nevertheless, it is not surprising that high fractions are being\\nused at some point in pediatric anesthesia. The induction and emergence\\nof anesthesia remain phases with a higher risk of desaturation and\\nhypoxia. Filling the functional residual capacity (FRC) with oxygen\\nleads to a prolonged apnea time, in which proper tube placement can be\\nachieved. This effect in pediatric anesthesia, however, remains matter of\\ndebate because of a raised metabolism (and thus increased oxygen\\nconsumption) in combination with a limited FRC in children [2]. Be-\\nsides, induction of anesthesia, including awake preoxygenation with\\nface mask ventilation, often leads to stress in non-cooperative children\\n[28] and counterproductively to waste of oxygen instead of maintaining\\n![image](/image/placeholder)\\n- Chart Type: line\\n|  | 0 kPa | 10 kPa | 20 kPa | 30 kPa | 40 kPa | 50 kPa | 60 kPa | 70 kPa | 80 kPa |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| item_01 | 87% PaO2 (kPa) | 93% PaO2 (kPa) | 95% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) | 100% PaO2 (kPa) |\\n\\nFig. 3.

Nevertheless, supplemental oxygen after\\ninduction is necessary anyway to avoid hypoxia during airway man-\\nagement. However, in our opinion, this does not relieve anesthesiolo-\\ngists from the task of titrating oxygen as with any other medical drug or\\nsubstance.\\nIn selected cases, oxygen was administered in a more reluctant\\nmanner. This was especially applicable to children who were scheduled\\nfor emergency or urgent surgery, to children with a higher ASA classi-\\nfication score, and to neonates and (ex-) prematures. Since the numbers\\nof these subgroups were small, it is not possible to draw firm conclu-\\nsions. It could be that a tendency of titrating inspired oxygen is visible in\\nthese subgroups.

One expla-\\nnation for this phenomenon could be the multidisciplinary approach for\\ndiagnostic or surgical procedures in (premature) neonates. Since the\\nimplementation of the ‘Dutch Recommendations in Perioperative Care\\nfor Neonates’ in 2018, this is the standard of care for every high-risk\\noperation on neonates in The Netherlands [29]. Preoperatively, all\\ninvolved health care workers (anesthesiologists, neonatologists, pedia-\\ntricians, surgeons) discuss every single case and define intraoperative\\ntargets (i.e. PaO2, SpO2, electrolytes, hemoglobin). Also, international\\nguidelines exist for the use of oxygen in neonatal intensive care units. A\\ntarget range is determined for every patient and oxygen is precisely\\ntitrated. Progress could be made in the nearby future in other subgroups\\nas well in titrating inspiratory oxygen based on SpO2 values. The median\\nSpO2 was 99% (IQR 98 to 100%); therefore, comparable cut-off values\\nshould be possible to implement in these other subgroups. In addition,\\nupon reaching a SaO2 of 100%, the corresponding PaO2 was already\\nabove 13.3 kPa; 100 mmHg. This suggests that patients maintaining a\\nsaturation level of 99–100% are consistently in a state of hyper-\\noxygenation, leading to the argument that oxygen should be adjusted\\naccordingly. It is known that pulse oximetry is relatively good at\\ndetecting hypoxemia. However, an overload of oxygen, with SpO2\\nvalues above 98–99%, is not detectable with pulse oximetry alone. The\\noxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shows the relation between the\\noxygen saturation of hemoglobin and the partial pressure of O2.\\nAlthough the partial pressure can continue to rise, the oxygen saturation\\nobviously cannot exceed 100%. The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a\\nsupplemental parameter that could provide insight into this moderate\\nhyperoxic range (13,3 - 26,6; 100–200 mmHg). Various recent studies\\nhave described its use, also during pediatric anesthesia [30–32]. The\\nORI could be useful during airway management, when high levels of\\noxygen are being used, to warn anesthesiologists when oxygen levels\\nstart to drop. After induction, anesthesiologists could use this parameter\\nto further titrate the fraction of inspired oxygen. Regardless, custom-\\nization will always have to take place. There is no universally applicable\\nsolution when it comes to oxygen supply. Factors such as age, comor-\\nbidities and ASA classification will serve as guiding parameters for the\\nanesthesiologist in the titration of oxygen.\\nOur results are slightly more conservative than those Morkane et al.\\nfound in a British adult population [20]. In a prospective multicenter\\nstudy they included 378 patients. The median FiO2 was 50% (IQR 41 to\\n55%) and median PaO2 was 24,7 kPa (IQR 17,9 to 30,8 kPa); 185 mmHg\\n(IQR 134 to 231). Referring to international guidelines, they observed a\\ndiscrepancy between these international perioperative guidelines and\\nevidence from other clinical contexts. Adult anesthesiologists seem to\\nlook for a balance and have to make a concession between these\\nguidelines and the majority of other clinical evidence. This might sug-\\ngest that Dutch pediatric anesthesiologists may be at least somewhat\\nmore cautious when it comes to intraoperative oxygen administration.\\n# 4.1. Limitations\\nThis single-center retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary\\npediatric hospital. Hence, these results represent the practice pattern of\\njust one academic children's hospital. External validation must be done\\ncarefully and is presumably limited. The data available for this study\\nwere accessible based on administrative codes. A complete dataset of\\nintraoperative values was available after extraction from the hospital\\nservers. Due to its retrospective nature, we strongly rely on the punctual\\nadministrative competencies of other anesthetic healthcare workers.\\nPrincipally, errors could have been made because of the time differences\\nbetween blood withdrawal and registration of the ABG values in the\\nEHR. The analyses done in this study were based on the time registered\\nin this system for each specific ABG. However, real-time withdrawal\\noccurred a few minutes before this registration. Therefore, uncertainty\\nremains concerning these timeframes and the related oxygenation\\nvalues. As administering oxygen is relatively stable intraoperatively, we\\nstill consider our results to be highly reliable. Finally, the attending\\nanesthesiologists carried out these analyses based on their judgment.\\nTogether with the retrospective nature of the study, it is challenging to\\npinpoint specific time points, such as induction, maintenance, or\\nemergence of anesthesia, to clarify when the samples were obtained.\\nSince there are still no clear international definitions on hypoxemia,\\nnormoxemia and hyperoxemia, one can argue about our chosen cut-off\\npoints, as these are merely arbitrary choices. These are not intended to\\nconceal or amplify the fundamental discussion about supplemental ox-\\nygen use during pediatric anesthesia.\\nFurthermore, no comments can be made regarding clinical outcomes\\nsince this was not part of the study. Although highly interesting, it is\\nprobably unfeasible to deduce the outcome parameters for the admin-\\nistration of oxygen alone. There could be selection bias because we only\\nincluded patients with an arterial catheter. These catheters were placed\\nsolely if seemed necessary by the attending anesthesiologist based on\\npatient and/or surgical characteristics. This could imply that at least\\nsome part of the included patients may have been in less optimal health\\nconditions, potentially exhibiting a lower pulmonary reserve compared\\nto the general pediatric surgery population. Besides, inclusion of longer\\nprocedures raises the likelihood of atelectasis formation and, in addi-\\ntion, patients with hemodynamic instability and/or fluid shifts are more\\nsusceptible to pulmonary edema.\\nAt the same time, blood withdrawal was only performed at the\\ndiscretion of the attending anesthesiologist. In some patients, an arterial\\ncatheter had already been placed, for example at the pediatric intensive\\ncare unit, although there was no need for blood sampling during the\\nprocedure. This could be the case if there was minimal blood loss or\\nduring very stable procedures. This could mean that only complex op-\\nerations and complex patients were included and that our findings are\\nonly comparable with similar cases. However, we cannot rule out that\\nour findings are comparable to those of a wider range of procedures.\\n4.2. Conclusion\\nThe administration of oxygen during pediatric anesthesia is barely\\nregulated. Intraoperative hyperoxemia was observed in approximately\\n90% of patients who required an arterial line for surgery at our single,\\ntertiary care pediatric institution. This might be particularly precarious\\nwhen considering the potential adverse effects of hyperoxemia. A more\\nconservative approach to oxygen administration was observed in spe-\\ncific subgroups, including emergency/urgent surgeries and (premature)\\nneonates. Future research should focus on outcomes related to hyper-\\noxemia during pediatric anesthesia, for example clinical relevant pul-\\nmonary complications, postoperative wound infections, length of\\nhospital stay and, although this might be challenging, mortality. Vali-\\ndation by multicenter and prospective studies would strengthen our\\nfindings. If possible, these outcomes should be related to age. Moreover,\\nit would be useful to reach consensus on definitions related to these\\ntopics before new studies are initiated.\\nFunding\\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding\\nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nJan J. van Wijk: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis,\\nProject administration, Writing – original draft.

Introduction\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening illness that\\nmainly affects preterm born infants, with a prevalence of 11% among\\nextremely preterm infants [1]. This condition is marked by progressive\\nintestinal inflammation and ischemia as well as critical illness with\\nrespiratory and hemodynamic instability. Its treatment consists of con-\\nservative management (e.g., antibiotics and bowel rest) combined with\\nsurgery in the most severe cases [2]. Surgical treatment is required in\\ntwo thirds of infants with confirmed NEC and entails resection of the\\naffected part of the intestine [3], under anesthesia.\\nProviding adequate anesthetic care is essential but challenging in\\npreterm infants with NEC, since these patients are often extremely\\npremature and suffer from excessive inflammation, respiratory and he-\\nmodynamic instability, electrolyte disturbances, and coagulopathy\\n[4–6]. Furthermore, as NEC is a rare disease, anesthesiologists may have\\nlimited experience treating these patients, which in turn is related to\\nincreased risk of complications [7,8].\\nCurrently, the optimal anesthetic care for infants undergoing surgery\\nfor NEC is unknown and practices may vary considerably as there are no\\ninternational guidelines and evidence regarding the efficacy and safety\\nof many anesthetics in infants is lacking [9]. Therefore, this study aimed\\nto describe current anesthesia practice for preterm infants undergoing\\nsurgery for NEC. Ultimately, this study aims to provide a step towards\\noptimizing anesthetic care for these vulnerable infants and thereby\\nimproving their outcomes.\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Study design and participants\\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to describe perioperative\\nanesthetic care provided to preterm infants undergoing surgery across\\nEurope for NEC. For this purpose, we developed a web-based survey.\\nAnesthesiologists working in centers where surgery for NEC is per-\\nformed, were requested to complete the survey. Participants were\\ninformed that completing the survey meant agreeing to participate in\\nthis study. This study was deemed exempt from ethical approval in line\\nwith the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO),\\nas it was a voluntary and anonymous survey among clinicians.\\n2.2. Survey\\nWe developed the survey in LimeSurvey version 2.06 (Limesurvey\\nGmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The included questions were designed\\nbased on a literature search and the expert opinion of the multidisci-\\nplinary group of authors. To establish the validity of the survey, an in-\\nternational group of six anesthesiologists reviewed its relevance,\\ncomprehensiveness, and comprehensibility. Based on their suggestions,\\nwe rephrased four questions and added multiple choice answer options\\nfor five questions.\\nThe final version of the survey included a total number of 46 ques-\\ntions: eight questions about demographics, two about protocols for\\nanesthesia practice, six about preoperative care, 26 about intraoperative\\ncare, two about postoperative care, and two about the respondent’s\\nopinion on the adequacy of anesthetic care for patients with NEC in their\\ncenter and ways it might be improved (Supplementary Table 1).\\nThe survey was distributed with help of the European Society for\\nPediatric Anesthesiology (ESPA) and several national (pediatric) anes-\\nthesiology societies. To maximize the number of responses, societies in\\ncountries with a low response rate were requested to send reminders.\\nThe survey was open from June 12, 2023 until January 8, 2024.\\n2.3. Statistical analyses\\nDescriptive analyses were presented as median (IQR) or number\\n(percentage). Agreement between anesthesiologists’ chosen agents for\\nanesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation was assessed by calculating\\nFleiss’ Kappa statistic. Analyses were conducted with RStudio version\\n2021.09.2 and R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Re-\\nsponses to the open question about the anesthesiologist’s opinion were\\nanalyzed with thematic content analysis. These responses were coded in\\nATLAS.ti Web (version 5.21.1).\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Responding anesthesiologists\\nA total number of 173 anesthesiologists from 31 European countries\\ncompleted the survey. The majority worked in university hospitals (n =\\n93, 54%) or university affiliated children’s hospitals (n = 61, 35%). Most\\nrespondents were pediatric anesthesiologists (n = 133, 77%) with over\\n15 years of experience (n = 121, 70%), and dedicating 80–100% of their\\nworking hours to pediatric anesthesiology (n = 95, 55%). The yearly\\nnumber of patients with NEC undergoing surgery in the respondent’s\\ncenter was highly variable, with approximately a quarter of centers\\ntreating 5–10 patients and a quarter treating 10–20 patients yearly.\\nTable 1 provides an overview of the respondents’ background charac-\\nteristics.

Preoperative care\\nOne respondent’s center treated zero patients with NEC yearly, and\\ntherefore this respondent received no further questions about anesthetic\\ncare for patients with NEC. Out of the remaining 172 respondents, three-\\nquarters (n = 128) reported that preoperative evaluation is always\\nperformed before surgery in patients with NEC, 19 (11%) that preop-\\nerative evaluation is not always performed, and 26 (15%) did not answer\\nthis question.\\nFurthermore, 62 respondents (36%) always, 77 respondents (45%)\\nsometimes, and 24 respondents (14%) never performed multidisci-\\nplinary team (MDT) consultation prior to anesthesia in patients with\\nNEC, while 10 respondents (5%) did not answer this question. The at-\\ntendants of these MDTs usually included a neonatologist (n = 131, 76%),\\nan anesthesiologist (n = 122, 71%), and a pediatric surgeon (n = 121,\\n70%). During these meetings, decisions were made regarding use and\\nchoice of inotropes/vasopressors (n = 86, 50%), ventilator strategy (n =\\n81, 47%), blood pressure targets (n = 51, 30%), use of anesthetics/an-\\nalgesics (n = 32, 19%), and/or target end-tidal CO2 concentrations (n =\\n22, 13%). Lastly, a few respondents reported discussing whether to\\nperform surgery (n = 5, 3%), the location of surgery (operating room vs.\\nneonatal intensive care unit) (n = 5, 3%), postoperative care (n = 5,\\n3%), the patient’s general condition (n = 5, 3%), and the surgical plan\\n(n = 4, 2%).\\nAlmost all respondents (n = 167, 97%) routinely assessed hemo-\\nglobin level and the vast majority (n = 136, 79%) routinely ordered\\nblood products before surgery.\\n3.4. Intraoperative care\\n3.4.1. Location of surgery\\nOver half of the respondents (n = 94, 55%) reported that surgery for\\nNEC in their center is generally performed in an operating room (OR), 44\\n(26%) that it is generally performed in the neonatal intensive care unit\\n(NICU), and 28 (16%) that these locations are both equally common.\\nFactors affecting the choice of location included the condition of the\\npatient (n = 144, 66%), ventilator strategy (n = 55, 32%), common\\npractice (n = 46, 27%), preference of the surgeon (n = 45, 26%),\\nagreements within the hospital (n = 35, 20%), preference of the anes-\\nthesiologist (n = 34, 20%), preference of the neonatologist (n = 18,\\n10%), and the patient’s weight (n = 6, 3%).\\n3.4.2. Monitoring\\nIn order of descending frequency of use, the types of monitoring used\\nduring surgery in patients with NEC were pulse oximetry (n = 172,\\n100%), temperature (n = 170, 99%), heart frequency (n = 165, 96%),\\nend-tidal CO2 concentration (n = 148, 86%), non-invasive blood pres-\\nsure (NIBP) (n = 144, 84%), electrocardiogram (ECG) 3 lead (n = 141,\\n82%), blood gas analysis (n = 138, 80%), diuresis quantity (n = 127,\\n74%), end tidal anesthetic concentration (n = 123, 72%), invasive blood\\npressure (n = 111, 65%), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (n = 93,\\n54%), transcutaneous CO2 concentration (n = 46, 27%), central venous\\npressure (n = 37, 22%), processed electroencephalogram (EEG) (n = 25,\\n15%), and ECG 5 lead (n = 10, 6%). Eighty percent of the respondents (n\\n= 138) used all standard monitoring, defined as electrocardiography,\\nblood pressure measurement (invasive and/or non-invasive), pulse ox-\\nimetry, CO2 measurement (end-tidal and/or transcutaneous), and tem-\\nperature measurement.\\n3.4.3. Used techniques for induction and maintenance of anesthesia\\nThe most used technique for induction in patients with NEC was\\nintravenous anesthesia (n = 73, 43%), followed by a combination of\\nintravenous and inhalation anesthesia (n = 57, 33%), inhalation anes-\\nthesia (n = 23, 13%), and high dose opiates (n = 10, 6%). Nine re-\\nspondents chose ‘other’, with five commenting that these patients have\\nusually already been intubated by the neonatologist, and the remainder\\nthat they use a combination of high dose opiates and a (low dose)\\ninhalation anesthetic.\\nFor maintenance, inhalation anesthesia (n = 71, 41%) was most\\nused, followed by intravenous anesthesia (n = 54, 32%), and a combi-\\nnation of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia (n = 37, 22%). Ten\\nrespondents chose other and commented that the used technique de-\\npends on the location of surgery (n = 4) or that they used other tech-\\nniques, including high dose opiates (n = 5) or regional anesthesia (n =\\n1). As illustrated in Fig. 2, switching resulted in a higher use of inhala-\\ntion anesthesia for maintenance compared with induction.\\nChi-square tests revealed that the used techniques for induction (p <\\n0.0001) and maintenance of anesthesia (p < 0.0001) significantly\\ndiffered depending on the location of surgery, with those performing\\nsurgery in the OR also using inhalation anesthesia, while those per-\\nforming surgery in the NICU almost exclusively used intravenous anes-\\nthesia or high dose opiates.\\n3.4.4. Used anesthetics, analgesics, and muscle relaxants\\nRespondents using intravenous anesthesia for induction predomi-\\nnantly used propofol (n = 58, 45%), followed by midazolam (n = 43,\\n33%), esketamine (n = 42, 32%), and thiopentone (n = 27, 21%)\\n(Fig. 3). Among those using inhalation anesthesia, sevoflurane was by\\nfar the most used (n = 79, 99%).

Discussion\\nThis survey among 173 anesthesiologists across 31 European coun-\\ntries identified a large variability in anesthetic care for preterm infants\\nundergoing surgery for NEC, particularly in the chosen agents for\\nanesthesia and their combinations. Intravenous anesthesia was most\\nused for induction, while inhalation anesthesia was favored for main-\\ntenance. For both induction and maintenance, the choice of technique\\nstrongly correlated with the location of surgery (OR vs. NICU). Propofol\\nand midazolam were the preferred intravenous anesthetics for induction\\nand maintenance, respectively, and sevoflurane the preferred inhalation\\nanesthetic for either. Compared with the variety of anesthetics used,\\nthere was more consensus on the choices for analgesics and muscle re-\\nlaxants, with fentanyl and rocuronium being the most commonly used.\\nApproximately a third of respondents used regional techniques intra-\\noperatively and approximately a quarter postoperatively. Postoperative\\npain management mainly included paracetamol and/or morphine. The\\nmajority of respondents regarded current anesthetic care for patients\\nwith NEC in their center as adequate, but many ideas were shared for\\nfurther improvement. These suggestions mostly revolved around\\nenhanced monitoring, implementation of protocols, and improved\\ncollaboration.\\nTo our knowledge, anesthetic care for patients undergoing surgery\\nfor NEC has not been studied on a European scale before. Two recent\\nmulticenter cohort studies, the APRICOT study and the NECTARINE\\nstudy, have assessed anesthetic care for various surgical and nonsurgical\\nprocedures in the pediatric and neonatal population, respectively\\n[8,10]. Similarly to our study, the APRICOT study found a large varia-\\ntion in the used anesthetics, with sevoflurane and propofol being the\\nmost used inhalation and intravenous anesthetics for induction and\\nfentanyl the most used analgesic [8]. The use of regional anesthesia in\\nour study was also comparable with that reported in the APRICOT study\\nand the NECTARINE study [10,11]. However, preterm infants with NEC\\nmay exhibit thrombocytopenia, which is a contraindication for neu-\\nraxial analgesia techniques, possibly explaining the low reported use of\\nepidural or caudal catheter techniques. A notable difference with the\\nAPRICOT study and the NECTARINE study was the far higher use of\\ninvasive blood pressure monitoring and NIRS in our study [8,10]. This\\nmay be explained by differences in study population, with the APRICOT\\nand NECTARINE study not only including critically ill children admitted\\nto the intensive care unit but also ASA I-II children undergoing minor\\nsurgical procedures that require less intensive monitoring. The post-\\noperative pain treatment observed in this study seems to resemble the\\npain treatment provided by neonatologists, which has been evaluated in\\na previous European survey [12]. This survey among neonatologists\\nfound that initial pain treatment for patients with NEC usually includes\\nparacetamol, fentanyl and/or morphine, and that in case of persisting\\npain, pain treatment is intensified by increasing the dose of the\\nadministered opiate and/or adding agents such as midazolam, ketamine\\nor dexmedetomidine [12].\\nThe heterogeneity in anesthetic care for patients with NEC identified\\nin this study may be explained by the lack of (international) guidelines.\\nExisting Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) consensus guidelines\\nfor perioperative care in neonatal intestinal surgery offer limited rec-\\nommendations regarding choice of anesthetics, and do not apply to\\npreterm infants and infants with complex surgical conditions such as\\nNEC [13]. Furthermore, this survey found that only a third of centers\\nhad written standard protocols for anesthesia in infants, and even fewer\\nhad specific protocols for patients with NEC. This lack of protocols is\\nprobably attributed to the paucity of evidence on this topic, with various\\nanesthetics being used off-label [9]. Consequently, the anesthetic care\\nprovided to patients with NEC likely varies depending on the anesthe-\\nsiologist’s preferences, availability of medication in the center, and local\\nhabits. This practice variability highlights the lack of evidence on what\\nis the most optimal anesthetic care for this patient group, although it\\nmay also reflect multiple treatments being equally effective [14].\\nNonetheless, the implementation of protocols was frequently mentioned\\nas an opportunity to improve anesthetic care for patients with NEC. The\\nresults of this survey may provide a first step towards developing a\\nguideline for perioperative anesthetic care for preterm infants with NEC.\\nAlternatively, individualized anesthetic plans could be developed ac-\\ncording to the 10-Ns principle proposed by the SAFETOTS initiative,\\nfocusing on physiological targets rather than choice of anesthetics [15].\\nIn addition to the implementation of protocols, respondents sug-\\ngested collaboration within the surgical team as a target to improve\\nanesthetic care for infants with NEC. Collaboration may be improved by\\nperforming preoperative multidisciplinary consultation, which four in\\nfive respondents of this survey reported doing structurally or occasion-\\nally. Additionally, this survey showed that preoperative evaluation is\\nnot always performed prior to surgery in patients with NEC, which may\\nreflect the urgency of surgery in the most severely ill patients. The ERAS\\nguidelines for neonatal intestinal surgery strongly recommend stan-\\ndardized perioperative communication with multidisciplinary teams\\n[13]. Preoperative briefings have been shown to improve team work and\\ncommunication in the operating room and may thereby improve patient\\noutcomes [16].\\nRespondents also frequently mentioned monitoring as an area for\\nimprovement, for instance through increased use of NIRS monitoring.\\nNIRS is not part of standard intraoperative monitoring yet, but may be a\\nvaluable addition as it enables swifter detection of tissue hypoxia [17].\\nMoreover, in infants with (suspected) NEC, cerebral and splanchnic\\nNIRS measurements may be used diagnostically or predictively [18]. In\\naddition, respondents suggested incorporation of EEG to monitor depth\\nof anesthesia. However, young infants often do not yet have differenti-\\nated EEGs, hampering the use of EEG-based monitoring devices [19].\\nMaintaining tissue perfusion in infants undergoing surgery is of the\\nutmost importance, since impaired tissue oxygenation, indicated by the\\npresence of hypotension, hypoxemia, and anemia, is associated with an'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'document_name': '1-s2.0-S0952818024001375-main.json', 'page': 9}, page_content='approximately 20-fold higher postoperative morbidity and mortality\\n[10,20]. In addition, the risk of morbidity and mortality is increased in\\nthe most preterm born infants and in those requiring intensive support\\nprior to surgery [10]. These risk factors are all highly relevant for infants\\nwith NEC, who are often extremely preterm and require admission to a\\nneonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, infants with NEC are\\nfrequently hemodynamically unstable and exhibit impaired tissue\\noxygenation, both cerebrally and intestinally [21–24]. Given their he-\\nmodynamic instability, the high use of propofol observed in this study is\\nsurprising, as propofol may induce hypotension in critically ill neonates\\n[25]. Anesthetic strategies for infants with NEC should focus on optimal\\nanalgosedation while safeguarding cerebral and intestinal perfusion,\\nand anesthesia should be provided by an experienced pediatric anes-\\nthesiologist to mitigate the risks of severe critical events [8,26].\\nDecreases in cerebral perfusion during surgery may contribute to the\\nincreased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in infants with sur-\\ngical NEC [27,28]. Other factors that may contribute to this increased\\nrisk include the greater disease severity and inflammation in infants\\nwith surgical NEC and possibly anesthetics-related neurotoxicity\\n[29,30]. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that neonatal exposure to\\nvarious anesthetics, including ketamine, midazolam, and inhalation\\nanesthetics, causes neuronal apoptosis and cognitive impairment [31].\\nHuman studies, on the other hand, have not identified clear neurotoxic\\neffects of anesthesia in infants, although high quality and well-powered\\nsafety trials are generally missing, especially in preterm infants. While\\nsome observational studies suggest an association between neonatal\\nanesthesia exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes\\n[32–38], a twin study and a sibling-matched cohort study (PANDA\\nstudy) found no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes between\\nthe exposed and unexposed sibling [39,40], suggesting an underlying\\nvulnerability may confound the association between anesthesia and\\nneurodevelopmental outcomes. This was supported by the General\\nAnesthesia compared to Spinal anesthesia (GAS) trial, which found that\\ninfants receiving awake regional anesthesia and infants receiving\\nsevoflurane-based general anesthesia did not differ in cognitive out-\\ncomes at 2 years and 5 years [41,42]. However, these prospective\\nstudies did not involve critically ill, preterm infants. As shown in this\\nsurvey, pediatric anesthesiologists remain cautious in patients with\\nNEC, with over a third of the respondents of this survey avoiding certain\\nanesthetics due to concerns about neurotoxicity.\\nA strength of this study is that it addresses a previously unexplored\\ntopic in our most vulnerable patients, namely anesthesia practice for\\npreterm infants with NEC, on a European scale. Furthermore, this study\\nprovides a comprehensive overview of anesthetic care for these patients,\\nentailing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. A limi-\\ntation inherent to survey research is the fact that only a subset of (pe-\\ndiatric) anesthesiologists completed the survey. Due to the technique\\nused for the dissemination of our survey, the number of anesthesiologists\\nwho received the invitation to our survey is unknown and we thus\\ncannot determine the response percentage. Possibly those who\\ncompleted the survey had a special interest in this topic, limiting the\\ngeneralizability of our results. In addition, Eastern European countries\\nwere underrepresented. Another limitation is that we did not specify the\\ntype of surgery for NEC, and therefore respondents may have had\\ndifferent types of surgery (e.g., laparotomy, peritoneal drainage) in\\nmind while completing the questionnaire. This may have affected their\\nresponses. Furthermore, to limit the time burden of completing the\\nquestionnaire, no questions were included regarding the used anesthetic\\ndoses. Given the potential adverse effects related with anesthetics, this\\ncould be interesting to assess in future studies. Moreover, qualitative\\nstudies may delve into the reasons for prescribing certain anesthetics.\\n# 5. Conclusions\\nAnesthesia practice for infants undergoing surgery for NEC in centers\\nacross Europe was highly variable, with over 30 different combinations\\nof anesthetics being used, highlighting the lack of consensus. In general,\\nresponding anesthesiologists considered the anesthetic care provided to\\npatients with NEC adequate, but they also offered suggestions for further\\nimprovement, mainly pertaining to monitoring, protocols, and multi-\\ndisciplinary collaboration. These results may serve as a first step towards\\n(consensus) guidelines for anesthetic care for infants with NEC.\\nRole of the funding source\\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding\\nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nJudith A. ten Barge: Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation,\\nWriting – original draft, Visualization.

Introduction\\nPatient blood management (PBM) refers to strategies imple-\\nmented pre-, intra- and postoperatively to prevent, detect and\\nmanage anemia (and/or iron deﬁciency) and bleeding, while\\nlimiting the need for transfusion [1,2]. Perioperative bleeding may\\naggravate or be responsible for anemia, which is an independent\\nrisk factor for morbidity and mortality [3–5]. Frequently per-\\nformed in the most anemic patients in surgical settings, transfu-\\nsion may itself be an independent factor of mortality and\\nmorbidity, regardless of the patient’s hemoglobin (Hb) levels\\nand comorbidities [5,6]. There is therefore a double need to correct\\nor limit perioperative anemia when surgeries are at risk of\\nbleeding, and to avoid or limit the use of transfusion during this\\nperiod. PBM is now recommended by a large number of medical\\nauthorities in various countries and specialties, including the\\nWorld Health Organization [2].\\nThree pillars are classically presented, which are the three main\\nobjectives of perioperative PBM programs:\\n- (cid:3) Optimization of red cell mass\\n- (cid:3) Minimization of blood loss\\n- (cid:3) Optimization of anemia tolerance.\\n\\nPerioperative PBM programs are recommended for all surgeries\\nat risk of bleeding, with measures adapted to the procedure and to\\nthe patient. In September 2022, the French National Authority for\\nHealth (HAS) published recommendations covering all aspects of\\nperioperative PBM [7]. This article presents an English translation\\nof the HAS recommendations (with the exception of those\\nconcerning PBM in obstetrics and how to implement a PBM\\nprogram) (Table 1) and a summary of the rationale underlying\\nthese recommendations. The full text of the rationale is available in\\nFrench on the HAS website (www.has-sante.fr).\\n2. Methods\\nSeveral international recommendations on PBM have been\\npublished in recent years. In view of the absence of French\\nrecommendations on this topic, and given the major public health\\n(decrease in morbidity and mortality) and economic (lower\\nconsumption of blood products) potential implications, the French\\nSociety of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR) and the\\nNational Collective of Obese Associations (CNAO) initiated the\\nreferral of this issue to the French National Authority for Health\\n(HAS) in June 2019. This topic has therefore been included in the\\nHAS 2020 work program. A working group of 19 experts\\n(physicians, pharmacists, paramedics, and administrative staff)\\nhas been set up between March 2021 and July 2022, in response to\\nrequests from the relevant National Professional Councils (CNP) –\\nwhich bring together healthcare professionals from the same\\nspecialty – and academic societies.\\nAfter a critical analysis of the literature, recommendations were\\nformulated with supporting arguments, each graded according to\\nthe level of evidence: A, B, C, or expert agreement (EA) (Table 2 ).\\nThese Good Practice Recommendations have been established\\naccording to the method described in the HAS methodological\\nguide available on its website: ‘‘Developing of Good Practice\\nRecommendations’’ [8].\\nAn external revision phase was carried out by a review group\\n(44 people proposed by the CNPs or academic societies or members\\nconcerned with the theme). The group was consulted online (using\\nthe GRaAL tool available on the HAS website) and gave an opinion\\nwith ratings and comments on the content and form of the initial\\nversion of the guidelines.\\nThe ﬁnal version of the guidelines was reviewed and validated\\nby the HAS board in July 2022 and subsequently posted on its\\nwebsite (www.has-sante.fr).\\n3. Management of preoperative anemia and iron deﬁciency\\nThe algorithm summarizing the recommendations of this part\\nis presented in Fig. 1.\\n3.1. Preoperative screening for anemia and iron deﬁciency\\nRationale. Before these new guidelines, French and international\\nguidelines already recommended the prescription of a blood count\\nbefore surgery with intermediate or high cardiac risk [9,10], or if\\nthe probability of perioperative transfusion was >10% or\\nperioperative blood loss >500 mL [11]. Prior to surgery at risk\\nof bleeding or transfusion, the optimal Hb level seems to be at least\\n13 g/dL, regardless of gender [11]. This risk must be adapted\\naccording to the center and the patien’s comorbidities.\\nIn the event of a preoperative Hb level <13 g/dL, an etiological\\ndiagnosis must be made in order to optimize the treatment of the\\nanemia [11]. Iron deﬁciency is the leading cause of anemia in the\\ngeneral population [12] and the prevalence of iron deﬁciency is\\nhigh in patients, especially in cases of cancer (40–60%) [13],\\nchronic renal failure (around 50%) [14] or heart failure (40–50% and\\nup to 75% depending on the study) [15,16]. Besides these\\nconditions, its prevalence is also often high before scheduled\\northopedic surgery (from 20% to 57%) [17,18] or before cardiac\\nsurgery (around 40%) [19].\\nIn clinical practice, the diagnosis of iron deﬁciency is based on\\nmeasurements of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT),\\npossibly associated with C-reactive protein measurement to\\nidentify inﬂammation [11,12]. The serum ferritin thresholds for\\nthe diagnosis of iron deﬁciency in the preoperative context remain\\npoorly deﬁned and are probably between 30 and 100 mg/mL, i.e.,\\nhigher than outside the perioperative situation. Indeed, these\\npatients will have increased iron requirements due to periopera-\\ntive blood loss, which is a direct loss of iron. A value of TSAT < 20%\\nhelps for the diagnosis of iron deﬁciency in the case of serum\\nferritin between 30 and 100 mg/mL [11] or between 100 and'),\n",

Treatment of preoperative anemia and iron deﬁciency\\n# 3.2.1. Iron supplementation\\nRationale. Many studies have shown the value of iron treatment\\nfor optimizing Hb levels in the preoperative period. A recent meta-\\nanalysis showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the need for transfusion\\nwhen intravenous iron was used preoperatively in orthopedic\\nsurgery, but this analysis also included studies with erythropoie-\\nsis-stimulating agents (ESAs) [21]. Another meta-analysis of\\npatients undergoing surgery for a fracture of the upper extremity\\nof the femur reached a similar conclusion [22]. However, in the\\ncontext of major orthopedic surgery, it is the use of EPO,\\nsystematically associated with iron, which has shown greater\\nefﬁcacy in reducing perioperative transfusion (see Section 3.2.2).\\nIn digestive surgery, several studies, including randomized\\ncontrolled trials, have demonstrated the value of oral or intrave-\\nnous iron therapy prior to major colorectal or abdominal surgery,\\nin particular, to reduce the need for perioperative transfusion [23–\\n26]. Although preoperative iron therapy did not always have an\\nimpact on perioperative transfusion in major digestive surgery,\\npostoperative Hb levels were signiﬁcantly increased several weeks\\nafter surgery in many studies [25]. In this context, intravenous iron\\nappears to be more effective than oral iron in rapidly increasing Hb\\n[27,28].\\nIn cardiac surgery, the use of intravenous iron at a dose of\\n1000 mg in the preoperative period, even immediately before\\nsurgery, increases postoperative Hb levels, with fewer anemic\\npatients in the weeks following surgery, but without reducing the\\nneed for transfusion [29]. Intravenous iron appears to be more\\neffective than oral iron in increasing serum ferritin even when Hb\\nlevels have not risen signiﬁcantly in the 3 weeks following\\ninjection [30]. Recent results indicate that serum ferritin <100 mg/\\nL (with or without associated anemia) is associated with increased\\nmortality, complications, transfusions, and length of hospital stay\\nafter cardiac surgery, thus encouraging the correction of iron\\ndeﬁciency in this context [31].\\n# Recommendations\\n- (cid:3) In case of iron deﬁciency anemia, iron supplementation is\\n- recommended to optimize red cell mass (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) For iron supplementation, the intravenous route should be\\n- preferred, and the dose must be sufﬁcient and adapted to the\\n- patient’s weight, in compliance with the instructions of the\\n- product’s Marketing Authorization (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) Taking into account current safety data on available products,\\n- ferric carboxymaltose can be administered in the context of\\n- home hospitalization (EA).\\n- (cid:3) The dose of 1 g of ferric carboxymaltose should be preferred (if\\n- weight >35 kg), as it can be carried out with a single 15-minute\\n- injection (EA).\\n- (cid:3) If used, intravenous iron supplementation should be adminis-\\n- tered as early as possible before surgery (usually within a month\\n- prior to surgery) (EA).\\n\\n3.2.2. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents\\nRationale. The efﬁcacy of ESAs prior to surgery (particularly\\northopedic or cardiac surgeries) has been evaluated in many\\nstudies and meta-analyses [32–35]. In these studies, ESAs were\\nshown to increase perioperative Hb levels and reduce periopera-\\ntive transfusion and postoperative complications. In hemorrhagic\\northopedic surgery, the use of ESAs in the preoperative period is\\ncurrently recommended only in cases of anemia, whatever the\\ncause of anemia, due to the potential risk of venous or arterial\\nthrombosis [36]. When ESAs are used in this context, the beneﬁt\\nappears to be greater, with no apparent increased risk of\\nthrombosis [33,35,37]. In cardiac surgery, the beneﬁt of ESAs\\nmainly concerns the reduction in perioperative transfusions in\\nrandomized controlled trials using single injections [38,39] and the\\nreduction of postoperative renal failure [40]. Erythropoietins alpha\\n(in biosimilar or non-biosimilar form) and zeta have now\\nmarketing authorization for their use to correct anemia prior to\\nmajor orthopedic surgery. Various doses have been evaluated in\\nthe literature, with 600 IU/kg by subcutaneous injection (often\\nrounded up to 40,000 IU) appearing to be the most widely used and\\nmore effective than 300 IU/kg [32–35,41].\\nESAs administered preoperatively should always be combined\\nwith iron therapy, even in the absence of iron deﬁciency\\nassociated with anemia, due to the increased iron requirement\\nresulting from the stimulation of erythropoiesis. Intravenous\\niron is preferable, as several studies have shown its superiority\\n(with a single injection of ferric carboxymaltose) over oral iron in\\nincreasing Hb levels more rapidly and limiting preoperative iron\\ndeﬁciency when ESA therapy is administered prior to major\\northopedic surgery [42,43] or before cardiac surgery [38,44]. The\\nuse of intravenous iron also allows a reduction in the number of\\ninjections of ESA to achieve a preoperative Hb level >13 g/dL,\\nwhile maintaining a beneﬁt in terms of reduced perioperative\\ntransfusions [45]. An example of preoperative EPO and IV iron\\nadministration is shown in Fig. 2.\\nIn cancer patients, the efﬁcacy of ESAs in increasing Hb levels\\nand reducing transfusion has been demonstrated [46–48]. There\\nare two concerns with ESA treatment in cancer patients: an\\nincreased risk of thrombosis and a potential increase in tumor\\nprogression. In recent studies and meta-analyses, mortality is not\\nincreased in cancer patients despite an almost systematic increase'),\n",

Example of possible schedule for the use of erythropoietin in the preoperative period.\\nThis protocol is proposed for the preoperative management of patients with a Hb <13 g/dL in case of: major orthopedic surgery (particularly total hip and knee arthroplasty),\\nspinal surgery at risk of bleeding, and cardiac surgery. This protocol can be used for other types of surgery in case of inﬂammatory anemia. In the case of cancer, a beneﬁt/risk\\ndiscussion should be held with the surgeon and/or oncologist in charge of the patient. Any contraindications to EPO (particularly recent ischemic disease or uncontrolled\\nhypertension) or iron must be respected. The EPO dose suggested on the diagram is 40,000 IU SC. However, it can be adapted to the patient’s weight (600 IU/kg). Iron\\nadministration (IV or oral) should be systematic when EPO is used in this context (except in special cases of major hyperferritinemia). The intravenous route is preferred, and\\nthe injection should be made as close as possible to the ﬁrst EPO injection. Ferric carboxymaltose at a dose of 1 g over 15 min can be used (500 mg if weight <35 kg). Days are\\ngiven as a guide and can be adapted according to the possibilities (patient or carers).\\nEPO: erythropoietin; FCM: ferric carboxymaltose; Hb: hemoglobin level; TSAT: transferrin saturation.\\nin the risk of thrombosis [46,48,49]. This is why the prescription of\\nESAs must be the subject of a beneﬁt/risk discussion with the\\nsurgeon in this context. Preoperative use of ESAs in cancer patients\\nat risk of bleeding should probably be the same as for major\\northopedic surgery, but probably with the objective of lower Hb\\nlevels (<12 g/dL) to limit the risk of thrombosis.\\n# Recommendations\\n- (cid:3) In major orthopedic surgery and cardiac surgery, the use of ESAs\\n- is recommended for patients with preoperative anemia to\\n- reduce the risk of transfusion (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) In the presence of anemia or inﬂammation, ESAs can be used for\\n- all types of surgery with a risk of bleeding (outside the\\n- marketing authorization), in the same way as for preoperative\\n- orthopedic surgery. In such cases, the use of ESAs should be\\n- discussed in relation to the beneﬁt-risk balance, particularly in\\n- the case of cancer, in order not to exceed a hemoglobin level of\\n- 12 g/dL to limit the risk of thrombosis (EA).\\n- (cid:3) Systematic iron supplementation, intravenous at best, is\\n- recommended at the start of ESA therapy to optimize\\n- erythropoiesis (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) It is recommended to adjust the number of erythropoietin\\n- injections according to the preoperative hemoglobin level and to\\n- monitor its effectiveness by monitoring the blood count (Grade\\n- C).\\n- (cid:3) It is recommended to start ESA treatment early enough, with a\\n- ﬁrst injection about 3 weeks before surgery ideally (EA).\\n\\n3.2.3. Vitamin treatments\\nRationale. There is no or few enough data to justify the\\nsystematic prescription of vitamins B9 and B12 in case of\\npreoperative anemia, in addition or not with iron or EPO\\n[11,50,51]. These recommendations therefore propose their use\\nin the event of observation of low plasma concentrations only.\\nRecommendations\\n(cid:3) Vitamin treatments (vitamin B9, vitamin B12) may be consid-\\nered if plasma folic acid is <3 ng/mL and/or plasma cobalamin is\\n<200 pg/mL (Grade C).\\n3.2.4. Referral to a specialist\\nRationale. If the etiology of the anemia is not known and not\\nrelated to the surgery, experts recommend obtaining it, especially\\nin case of Hb <10–11 g/dL, either directly or using a referral to\\nanother specialist (e.g., hepato-gastroenterologist, gynecologist,\\ninternist, hematologist). Indeed, even if iron deﬁciency is diag-\\nnosed and treated, the knowledge of the etiology of this iron\\ndeﬁciency (in particular blood loss linked to gastrointestinal or\\ngynecological bleeding) can facilitate the correction of this anemia\\nafter surgery. However, this diagnosis is sometimes difﬁcult to\\nmake in clinical practice before surgery, due to the sometimes\\nshort times before surgery (especially in the case of semi-urgent\\nsurgery or cancer surgery). This etiological assessment can then be\\ncarried out postoperatively. This recommendation is an expert\\nagreement because there is little or no data evaluating the value of\\nthe referral to an anemia specialist (other than an anesthetist or the\\nsurgeon). However, some international guidelines have already\\nrecommended the use of a specialist for certain types of anemia\\n[52].\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) In case of preoperative hemoglobin level below 10–11 g/dL, a\\n- specialized etiological workup is recommended preoperatively,\\n- or, failing that, postoperatively, if the cause is unknown (EA).\\n\\n4. Intraoperative patient management in the context of patient\\nblood management\\n4.1. Pharmacological treatments\\nRationale. Tranexamic acid binds to plasminogen and prevents\\nﬁbrin degradation. Many studies and meta-analyses have demon-\\nstrated its efﬁcacy in reducing blood loss and intra- and\\npostoperative transfusion in almost all potentially hemorrhagic\\nsurgeries, the majority of studies having been performed in major\\nhip and knee surgery and in cardiac surgery [53–55]. Tranexamic\\nacid has also demonstrated its potential interest in other surgical\\nspecialties. In liver surgery, for example, it reduces the need for\\ntransfusion without increasing the incidence of thrombotic events'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'document_name': '1-s2.0-S2352556824000626-main.json', 'page': 7}, page_content='[56] and reduces blood loss without increasing complications\\n(including thrombosis) in abdominal, pelvic, gynecological, and\\nurological surgery [57], with limited data however for colorectal\\nsurgery. Thus, the prophylactic use of tranexamic acid is\\nrecommended with a Grade A for orthopedic and cardiac surgeries\\nand with a Grade B for other surgeries with a hemorrhagic risk, for\\nprophylactic or curative purposes.\\nTranexamic acid is effective on these parameters when used\\nintravenously, ‘‘topically’’ by the surgeon, or orally, and seems even\\nmore effective when a ‘‘topical’’ and intravenous combination is\\nused, particularly in major orthopedic surgery [53]. However, in\\nthe absence of contraindications, the intravenous route is the most\\nstudied route in this context and should be preferred. This is the\\nreason why the preferential use of the intravenous route is\\nrecommended with a Grade B in these guidelines. The ‘‘topical’’\\nroute can be used in combination or in the presence of\\ncontraindications to oral or intravenous use.\\nThe dose and frequency of injections are still debated in the\\nliterature. However, if used intravenously, a dose of at least 1 g (or\\naround 15 mg/kg if weight less than 65 kg), if possible before or at\\nthe same time as the surgical incision, is probably to be preferred in\\nscheduled surgery where there is a risk of bleeding, as in the\\nhemorrhagic shock and in postpartum hemorrhage [58–60]. Exclud-\\ning hemorrhagic shock, repeating doses, or continuing an infusion in\\nthe hours following surgery is possible but its beneﬁt has not been\\nproven. In cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass, larger\\ndoses of around 50–100 mg/kg are regularly used in cardiac surgery\\ncenters and in studies on the subject [61–64]. These higher doses are\\nassociated with a statistically signiﬁcant, but sometimes clinically\\nirrelevant, reduction in bleeding and transfusion [61,62]. In addition,\\nhigher doses are associated in several studies with an increased risk\\nof seizures [64]. Thus, doses higher than 100 mg/kg should not be\\nused and doses below 50 mg/kg and close to common doses used in\\nnon-cardiac surgery are probably sufﬁcient.\\nDifferent administration schedules proposed in the scientiﬁc\\nliterature are presented in Fig. 3. This ﬁgure reminds readers that,\\neven in cardiac surgery, the dose of 100 mg/kg should not be\\nexceeded.\\nA history of convulsions contraindicates its intravenous or oral\\nuse. However, this contraindication is relative in cases of major\\nhemorrhagic risk.\\nUnlike tranexamic acid, ﬁbrinogen has shown no clinically\\nsigniﬁcant beneﬁt in reducing transfusions when used prophylac-\\ntically in recent randomized controlled trials, including in surgical\\nprocedures with bleeding risk, such as cardiac surgery or liver\\ntransplant surgery [65].\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) Prophylactic use of tranexamic acid is recommended to reduce\\n- bleeding and transfusion in cardiac and major orthopedic\\n- surgeries (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) For other types of surgery, tranexamic acid can be used in case of\\n- bleeding risk for prophylactic or curative purposes (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) For prophylactic use, it is recommended to use tranexamic acid\\n- preferably by slow intravenous route at the start of the\\n- procedure at a dose of 1 g (or 10–20 mg/kg) (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) The injection of tranexamic acid may be supplemented by\\n- reinjections or continuous infusion, particularly in cases of\\n- hemorrhage (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) Tranexamic acid can be applied locally in addition to the\\n- intravenous route, particularly in orthopedic surgery (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) In cases of severe hemorrhage or hemorrhagic shock, tranexamic\\n- acid use is recommended as soon as possible (Grade A); in these\\n- cases, the 1 g intravenous dose, possibly followed by a second\\n- 1 g dose, is recommended (in the absence of a previous dose)\\n- (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) Prophylactic ﬁbrinogen administration is not recommended\\n- (Grade A).\\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n'),\n",

The use of a tourniquet in prosthetic knee surgery\\nimproves the visualization of structures and reduces intraopera-\\ntive bleeding. However, a recent meta-analysis did not show a\\nreduction in total blood loss or in the volume of blood transfused,\\nand conversely showed a decrease in functional recovery and an\\nincrease in the incidence of postoperative venous thrombosis\\n[66]. Other meta-analyses on this subject concluded to an increase\\nin postoperative blood loss and postoperative pain [67,68].\\nThe real beneﬁt of cell salvage on postoperative complications\\nand mortality remains debated. However, its use has allowed a\\ndecrease in homologous transfusion in potentially very hemor-\\nrhagic surgeries such as open aortic surgery, cardiac surgery, and\\nscoliosis surgery [69–71]. However, the existing data seem\\nreassuring on the risk of metastasis due to the use of cell salvage,\\nwith tumor cells reinjected potentially ‘‘ineffective’’ and at a\\nconcentration lower than that present in the circulating blood\\n[72]. Similarly, the risk of infection associated with the use of cell\\nsalvage in a patient with an infection could not be demonstrated\\n[73] and the use of a leukocyte ﬁlter remains to be assessed to\\nreduce this risk.\\nApart from cardiac and thoracic surgery, numerous studies have\\nnow shown that systematic and prophylactic postoperative\\ndrainage does not improve postoperative morbidity, including in\\northopedic and digestive surgery [74–76]. Excluding complex\\nsituations or special patients, the use of systematic drains could\\neven have a negative impact on blood loss since the introduction of\\nPBM programs.\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) It is suggested to carry out the application of surgical dressings\\n- (tamponade dressing) at the end of the procedure to detect a\\n- hemostasis disorder and reduce bleeding (Grade C).\\n- (cid:3) In prosthetic knee surgery, the systematic use of a tourniquet to\\n- reduce cumulated perioperative blood loss is not recommended\\n- (Grade A)\\n- (cid:3) Cell salvage devices are recommended for cardiac surgery, aortic\\n- surgery, spinal deformity surgery, complex prosthetic revision\\n- surgery of the lower limb, and any surgery where the risk of\\n- transfusion is deemed to be very high, particularly for certain\\n- patient populations (e.g., rare blood groups) (Grade B).

General measures\\nRationale. Intraoperative hypothermia is associated with an\\nincrease in morbidity and mortality. The French guidelines have\\nalready recommended measures to avoid perioperative hypother-\\nmia, in order to reduce the occurrence of hemorrhagic complica-\\ntions in particular [77]. The link between hypothermia and blood\\nloss has been observed in numerous studies and in meta-analyses\\n[78,79]. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis observed efﬁcacy in\\nreducing the use of transfusion [78], however not observed in other\\nstudies. Among the existing techniques for heating, forced-air\\nwarming systems seem effective in limiting blood loss [79].\\nSince anemia and hemorrhage are major risk factors for\\nmorbidity and mortality in the perioperative period, these two\\nparameters must be closely monitored during surgery. The amount\\nof blood loss can be estimated in containers or graduated collection\\nbags, by the weight of the compresses, and visually in the operating\\nﬁeld, the operator’s gown, and the ﬂoor. This monitoring of blood\\nloss can make it possible to anticipate symptomatic or corrective\\ntreatment before the appearance of clinical signs or to undertake\\nsurgical or medicinal therapeutic measures.\\nA rapid measurement of the hemoglobin level must be possible\\nin the event of haemorrhage. The blood count in the laboratory is\\nthe reference technique but the delay between the sample and the\\nresult can be long. Some devices allow rapid measurement of\\ncapillary hemoglobin (Hemocue1 for example) and are readily\\navailable. Their precision is generally satisfactory and they can\\ntherefore be an additional useful tool in this context [80,81]. More\\nrecent devices allow now the non-invasive measurement of\\nhemoglobin (SpHb in particular). Their accuracy is relatively\\nsatisfactory too, but less than capillary hemoglobin and much less\\nthan hemoglobin measured in the laboratory, especially for low\\nvalues of hemoglobin [80,81]. Some studies have shown an interest\\nin guiding transfusion, but their real usefulness remains to be\\nassessed.\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) It is recommended that normothermia ((cid:4)36.5 8C) be maintained\\n- throughout the whole perioperative period to reduce bleeding\\n- complications (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) In case of major surgery or surgery at risk of bleeding,\\n- continuous intraoperative temperature monitoring should be\\n- used, by esophagus, bladder, rectal or blood route (EA).\\n- (cid:3) In case of hemorrhagic surgery, blood loss must be estimated\\n- (direct measurement in suction bottles, estimated ‘‘visual’’\\n- losses, weight of surgical dressings) and rapid intra- and\\n- postoperative hemoglobin level monitoring must be available\\n- (EA).\\n- (cid:3) For surgeries at risk of bleeding, rapid assessment of hemoglobin\\n- levels and hemostasis must be available in the form of short\\n- circuits and/or delocalized biology, combined with decisional\\n- therapeutic algorithms (Grade C).\\n\\n5. Postoperative management in the context of patient blood\\nmanagement\\n5.1. Monitoring and detection of postoperative bleeding and anemia\\nRationale. The prevalence of postoperative anemia is around\\n80–90% after major orthopedic surgery [82] and 76% in cancer\\ncolorectal surgery [83]. Bleeding is a major complication of\\nsurgery, which can lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality,\\nmean length of stay, and risk of admission to an intensive care unit\\n[1].\\nIn a study of patients undergoing lower-limb arthroplasty (hip\\nor knee) or coronary artery bypass grafting, transfusion was\\npredicted in 97% of patients by three independent variables:\\npreoperative Hb level, degree of perioperative bleeding, and\\npostoperative minimal Hb level [84].\\nHb measurement is a routine postoperative test and, for most\\nuncomplicated surgeries, Hb levels begin to rise after the 3rd or 4th\\npostoperative day only. Non-invasive Hb monitoring devices may\\nbe of interest in the postoperative period too for monitoring occult\\nbleeding, follow-up of hemorrhage, or response to treatment of\\nanemia, but further studies are needed to assess their value.\\nDiagnosis of postoperative iron deﬁciency can be difﬁcult, as\\nthe iron markers (serum ferritin and TSAT) are disturbed in the\\nhours following surgery. Inﬂammation is almost always present,\\nand is responsible for increased ferritin synthesis. Serum ferritin\\nand TSAT are generally interpretable the ﬁrst days after surgery\\n[85].\\nIn the postoperative period, the decrease of Hb levels is almost\\nalways related to blood loss (excluding hemodilution or hemoly-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'document_name': '1-s2.0-S2352556824000626-main.json', 'page': 9}, page_content='sis). In most cases, this decrease of Hb levels results in direct iron\\nloss, which can lead to iron deﬁciency if reserves were already low,\\nand increasing Hb levels will therefore require iron supplementa-\\ntion. Consequently, if anemia appears or is more severe than\\npreoperatively, oral or intravenous supplementation is necessary if\\nthe anemia is to be rapidly corrected. The indication for iron\\ntherapy is then based on the Hb level and not on serum ferritin.\\nFurthermore, if iron supplementation (including intravenous iron)\\nallows an increase in the hemoglobin level, this will be especially\\nvisible from the second to fourth weeks following the supplemen-\\ntation [86]. It is therefore after this time interval that it may be\\nnecessary to control the hemoglobin level.\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) It is recommended to limit systematic blood sampling and, if\\n- possible, the volume per sample, to reduce the incidence of\\n- anemia and transfusion (EA).\\n- (cid:3) The use of rapid capillary hemoglobin tests at the patient’s\\n- bedside can reduce the number of samples (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) Hemoglobin level monitoring is recommended in the early\\n- postoperative days in case(s) of preoperative anemia and/or\\n- intra- or postoperative blood loss and/or hemodynamic insta-\\n- bility. These tests can be performed outside the hospital if the\\n- patient has been discharged (EA).\\n- (cid:3) A repeat blood count and an iron workup are recommended\\n- around 4 weeks after a hemorrhagic surgery and/or in the event\\n- of postoperative anemia, with the involvement of the general\\n- practitioner (EA).\\n\\n# 5.2. Iron supplementation\\nRationale. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that\\nintravenous iron supplementation reduces transfusion, length of\\nstay, postoperative infection rates, and fatigue [17,29,87]. Some\\nintravenous iron formulations, in particular the ferric carboxy-\\nmaltose available in France, allow rapid infusion (15–60 min) of\\nthe necessary dose of iron (often around 1000 mg) and therefore\\nallow, despite their higher cost, to be carried out at once during\\nhospitalization and to avoid prolonged hospitalization or rehospi-\\ntalization for infusion of a 2nd or 3rd dose to complete the\\nestimated total dose.\\nThe dose of iron to be injected must be adapted to the Hb level\\n(e.g., using the Ganzoni formula), the preoperative iron status, the\\nextent of the decrease of Hb level, and any perioperative\\ntransfusion (one unit of packed red blood cells provides an average\\nof 200 mg of iron). However, transfusion is not a contraindication\\nto iron injections since, according to the rules of a ‘‘restrictive’’\\ntransfusion strategy, the post-transfusion Hb level should in all\\ncases be below 10 g/dL.\\nMajor adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, infection or\\noxidative stress have been described with intravenous iron (mostly\\nwith dextran iron), but such side effects do not appear to be\\nsigniﬁcant with newer preparations such as ferric carboxymaltose,\\niron isomaltoside and low-molecular-weight dextran iron.\\nA normal Hb level does not exclude the presence of iron\\ndeﬁciency. Iron deﬁciency anemia occurs at a relatively advanced\\nstage of iron deﬁciency. Patients who are not anemic, but whose iron\\nstores are depleted, may present symptoms associated with this\\ndeﬁciency, in particular asthenia and reduced exercise tolerance\\n[88]. There are currently no data to suggest iron supplementation for\\npre- or postoperative iron deﬁciency in the absence of anemia\\n(except in situations of pregnancy or heart failure).\\nRecommendations\\n(cid:3) In the event of postoperative anemia with a hemoglobin level\\nbelow 12 g/dL due to signiﬁcant blood loss and/or untreated\\n- preoperative iron deﬁciency, early administration of iron is\\n- recommended, preferably intravenously (Grade B).\\n- (cid:3) The dose of one gram of ferric carboxymaltose should be\\n- preferred (for weights over 35 kg), as it can be carried out in a\\n- single 15-minute injection (EA).\\n\\n5.3. Transfusion and transfusion thresholds\\nRationale. Transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct\\nperioperative anemia and blood loss is an independent risk factor\\nfor increased postoperative morbidity, mortality and length of stay\\n[89]. Since the 2000s, many studies with a high level of evidence\\nand several meta-analyses have shown that restrictive transfusion\\nthresholds (Hb generally between 7 and 8 g/dL versus more than\\n10 g/dL) are well tolerated, do not increase morbidity and\\nmortality at 30 or 90 days, and make it possible to avoid or\\nreduce blood transfusion [90–92]. A recent meta-analysis that\\nidentiﬁed 19 systematic reviews pooling data from 68 randomized\\ncontrolled trials reported no signiﬁcant difference in mortality\\nbetween restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies [93]. The\\nrestrictive strategy therefore appears safe as it reduces the number\\nof patients transfused and the number of units of packed red blood\\ncells received, without signiﬁcantly modifying death rates and\\noverall morbidity. French [36] or international guidelines [94–96]\\nuse Hb at 7 g/dL as the transfusion trigger threshold for patients\\nwith no particular history and who are hemodynamically stable.\\nHowever, transfusion should not be guided by Hb alone, but by\\nclinical tolerance. For elderly patients or those with a history of\\ncardiovascular disease, many studies showed that transfusion\\nthresholds should probably be less stringent than for the rest of the\\npopulation, i.e. at least above 8 g/dL, and adapted to the patient’s\\ntolerance [97–99]. The values of these thresholds remain however\\ntheoretical, as most studies include methodological and statistical\\nbiases (deﬁnition of a restrictive or liberal threshold, timing of\\nrandomization sometimes done after transfusion, and deﬁnition of\\nthe Hb threshold to be reached). The fundamental criterion\\ntherefore remains the clinical tolerance of the anemia.\\nOne single (versus multiple) unit of packed red blood cells per\\ntransfusion in patients without active hemorrhage and hemody-\\nnamically stable with clinical reassessment and/or with a different\\nHb level (post-transfusion) is a recommendation taken up by many\\ninternational guidelines, based on medical common sense and on\\nstudies with currently a low level of evidence (retrospective or\\nbefore-after studies).\\nRecommendations\\n- (cid:3) A ‘‘restrictive’’ transfusion threshold (target Hemoglobin level\\n- between 7 and 8 g/dL, or higher depending on comorbidities and\\n- patient tolerance) is recommended in the postoperative period\\n- of non-cardiac surgery for most clinically stable adult inpatients\\n- (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) A ‘‘restrictive’’ hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is\\n- recommended for critical care patients in general, including\\n- septic patients, in order to reduce the need for packed red blood\\n- cell transfusion without increasing morbidity and mortality\\n- (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) A ‘‘restrictive’’ hemoglobin transfusion threshold between\\n- 7.5 and 8.0 g/dL is recommended in the postoperative period\\n- of cardiac surgery, in order to reduce the need for packed red\\n- blood cell transfusion without increasing morbidity and\\n- mortality (Grade A).\\n- (cid:3) The transfusion threshold must be adapted to the patient’s\\n- comorbidities, clinical tolerance and hemodynamic status (EA).\\n- (cid:3) Transfusion of a single unit of packed red blood cells at a time is\\n- recommended (except in the case of active hemorrhage deemed\\n- important, or in the case of a hemoglobin level expected <7 g/dL\\n'),\n",

Conclusion\\nThis article presents a summary of the argument and a\\ntranslation of the recommendations of the French National\\nAuthority for Health (HAS) concerning blood management in the\\npre-, intra-, and postoperative periods (excluding obstetrics). The\\nmain interest of these recommendations is to group together all\\nthe measures to be taken over the entire perioperative period and\\naccording to the three main pillars of PBM, drawn up from the most\\nrecent data on the day of publication in September 2022. A certain\\nnumber of these measures have high levels of evidence, in\\nparticular those concerning screening and treatment of anemia\\nand preoperative iron deﬁciency and the use of tranexamic acid in\\nthe event of bleeding surgery. Other recommendations are based\\non lower levels of evidence and based on expert opinion.\\nAdditional studies will be necessary to clarify these points and\\nmay change these recommendations in the future.\\n# Funding\\nThe writing of the recommendations and the argument ‘‘Gestion du capital sanguin\\nen pre´ , per et postope´ ratoire et en obste´ trique’’ was supported by the Haute\\nAutorite´ de Sante´ (HAS), but the writing of this summary article did not beneﬁt from\\nany speciﬁc funds.\\n# Declaration of interest statement\\nAll the authors of this special article are the experts and authors\\nof the working group for the recommandations entitled ‘‘Gestion\\ndu capital sanguin en pre´ , per et postope´ ratoire et en obste´ trique’’\\npublished by the French National Authority for Health (Haute\\nAutorite´ de Sante´ , HAS) and therefore have a link of interest with\\nthis Authority.\\nThe authors communicated their public declarations of interest\\nto the HAS.

It found neuraxial anesthesia to be associated with a lower rate of symptomatic thromboembolic events than general anesthesia. However, results using rivaroxaban with neuraxial blockade are limited, and risks are hard to evaluate due to the low incidence of related complications. ESA and ASRA guidelines suggest extreme caution when using rivaroxaban in conjunction with neuraxial anesthesia.

While neurological function is critical, it may need monitoring over a longer period due to the slow development of potential injuries. In clinical practice, particularly during total knee and hip replacement surgeries, non-neuraxial regional techniques like continuous peripheral nerve blocks are preferred over epidural analgesia due to their similar analgesic profiles and fewer side effects. Studies suggest that the adductor canal block post-knee surgery preserves quadricep strength better than the femoral nerve block. The relationship between peripheral nerve blocks and the risk of wound hematoma in patients on anticoagulants like heparin is still under investigation. Current guidelines suggest using peripheral nerve blocks as an alternative to neuraxial techniques. Research on OACs such as rivaroxaban and dabigatran indicates a low incidence of hematomas or major bleedings, making them viable for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. The document emphasizes managing OACs effectively alongside regional anesthesia to prevent bleeding complications. Thromboprophylaxis with OACs usually begins shortly after surgery, with their effectiveness established rapidly post-initiation, minimizing the need for bridging therapy.

While type 2 diabetes (T2DM) accounts for 90–95% of diabetic cases, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) comprises a smaller percentage of surgical patients. There are also specific, lesser-known types of DM, such as gestational DM, DM after pancreatitis, and those induced by glucocorticoid use. Each type has distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and anticipated glycemic control. The research highlights the risks of perioperative glucose dysregulation, especially in patients with uncommon forms of DM, and underscores the link between poor glucose management and unfavorable surgical outcomes. Currently, perioperative guidelines generally do not differentiate between types of DM, suggesting care should be uniform. However, the authors advocate for a more individualized approach to DM management, tailored to the specific type of diabetes.

T1DM is characterized by immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, requiring exogenous insulin to avoid ketoacidosis. It necessitates careful perioperative insulin management to avoid hypoglycemia, which is more common in T1DM than insulin-treated T2DM. Other forms, like LADA and GDM, share variability in insulin deficiency and require specific considerations, such as not omitting basal insulin. Glucocorticoid-induced DM and Post-Transplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) are influenced by immunosuppressant and corticosteroid treatments, increasing insulin resistance and the risk of hyperglycemia, which can impact surgical outcomes.

Specific attention is needed for glucose control in T1DM patients during pre-operative screening, particularly those with high HbA1c levels. Insulin pumps, also known as Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) devices, are utilized to manage glucose levels by administering rapid-acting insulin. Perioperative guidelines suggest maintaining CSII during minor surgeries, but frequent glucose monitoring is necessary. Switching to intravenous insulin infusion is recommended for major surgeries due to factors like increased insulin requirements and potential issues with CSII in post-operative settings.

It found significant variability in anesthetic practices, particularly in the use of anesthesia agents. Intravenous anesthesia, primarily using propofol for induction and midazolam for maintenance, and inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane were common, while fentanyl and rocuronium were popular choices for analgesics and muscle relaxants. Approximately a third of the respondents used regional anesthesia techniques during or after surgery, and postoperative pain management often included paracetamol and/or morphine. There was a general consensus on the adequacy of current anesthetic care, but respondents suggested improvements in monitoring, protocol implementation, and collaboration among healthcare teams. Many noted the lack of standardized guidelines for NEC, considering the condition's complexity and the evidence scarcity. Enhanced monitoring, especially with NIRS and EEG, was recommended.

A literature search conducted in December 2020 and January 2021 identified 12 documents related to PBM guidelines, from which 8 were confirmed as actual PBM guidelines. The European Commission has been active in promoting PBM through initiatives like the “Optimal Blood Use Project” and guidelines for national PBM program development. The European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) published updated guidelines for managing severe perioperative bleeding in 2017, recommending the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) and aprotinin in certain surgical contexts, although detailed dosing regimens were not provided. The EACTS and EACTA jointly issued specific guidelines for cardiac surgery in 2018, outlining recommendations for preoperative management, including testing for bleeding risks, and the use of antifibrinolytics during surgery.
